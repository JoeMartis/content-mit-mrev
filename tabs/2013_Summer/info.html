<h2>Grading and Administration</h2>

<h3>Due Dates and Times</h3>

<p>Due dates for each unit are listed on the left-hand navigation bar. All assignments are due just before midnight (UTC) on Sundays, but you can do them all days or even weeks in advance.</p> 

<p>Because we have a worldwide audience, this course is timed by Greenwich Mean Time. <b><i>All times listed in the left-hand navigation are in UTC, or Greenwitch Mean Time, which is probably not your local time zone.</i></b> You can use <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx">this link</a> or <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html">this one</a> to convert UTC times into your local time.</p>
<p>The current UTC date and time are:</p>

<p>Note that some units are due on the same day.</p>

<h3>Units</h3>

<p>There are 11 required units in this course:
<ol>
	<li>Newtonâ€™s Laws</li>
	<li>Interactions and Force (due with previous unit)</li>
	<li>Applying Newton's Laws</li>
	<li>Describing Motion</li>
	<li>Core Models (due with previous unit)</li>
	<li>Applying SIM to Problems</li>
	<li>Momentum and Multi-Body Systems</li>
	<li>Mechanical Energy and Work</li>
	<li>Torque and Rotation</li>
	<li>Rotation, Translation, and Energy</li>
	<li>Angular Momentum</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The first six of them will be available at the start of the course. More will become available as the course continues. In addition, there are three optional units:
<ul>
	<li>Orbits</li>
	<li>Harmonic Oscillation</li>
	<li>Review</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You only need to complete the first 11 units to obtain a certificate, but completing more units will cement your understanding and improve your ability to handle multi-concept and multi-part problems.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>There are three types of problem: Checkpoint, Homework, and Quiz.
<ul>
	<li><b>Checkpoint</b> problems are mixed in with the text. Checkpoints are worth 20% of your total grade. They are graded on an "attempt" basis. You do not have to get them right, but you do have to try them.</li>
	<li>Homework problems are found at the end of each unit. Homework is worth 40% of your total grade. You need to get 15 points total each time homework is due. (Typically this means 15 points per unit, but sometimes two units are due due together.) Homework problems only add to your total when you get them right.</li>
	<li>Quizzes are worth 40% of your total grade. Each quiz problem is worth the same number of points. You must achieve a quiz grade greater than 60% to receive a certificate. The lowest quiz score is dropped.</li>
</p>

<p>Each problem - that is, each time you see the "Check/Save/Show Answer" boxes - is worth a number of points as indicated. Problems without a point total marked are worth 1 point. Most problems are worth between 1 and 3 points though some sections of multi-part problems are worth less.</p>

<p>Points are only compared within a particular section, so homework points and quiz points should not be compared to each other. They are averaged separately before being combined into your grade.</p>
