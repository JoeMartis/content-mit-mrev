<h2>Grading and Administration</h2>

<h3>Due Dates and Times</h3>

<p>Due dates for each unit are listed on the left-hand navigation bar. All assignments are due just before midnight (UTC) on Sundays, but you can do them all days or even weeks in advance.</p> 

<p><b><i>Note that the times listed are UTC, or Greenwitch Mean Time, which is probably not your local time zone.</i></b> You can use <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx">this link</a> or <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html">this one</a> to convert UTC times into your local time.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>(This section is unfinished)</p>

<p>Each problem - that is, each time you see the "Check/Save/Show Answer" boxes - is worth a number of points as indicated. Most problems are worth between 1 and 3 points though some sections of multi-part problems are worth less. Problems without a point total marked are worth 1 point.</p>

<p>Points are only compared within a particular section - homework points and quiz points are averaged separately before being combined into your grade.</p>
