<h2>Course Outline</h2>

<p>We cover the standard topics in an introductory college level mechanics course, but with an emphasis on helping you understand how these concepts interrelate and how to use this understanding to analyze and solve problems where several concepts apply.</p>

<p>Our emphasis on overview rather than basic formulas and procedures means that you will find our course much easier if you already have exposure to and familiarity with some of the core concepts: Newton’s laws, momentum, energy, and ideally a bit of rotation and/or angular momentum. </p>

<p>This course has been composed by Prof. Dave Pritchard and his education research group: REsearch in Learning Assessing and Tutoring Effectively (<a href="http://RELATE.MIT.edu">http://RELATE.MIT.edu</a>). It embodies our Modeling Applied to Problem Solving (MAPS) pedagogical approach.</p>

<p>We now briefly summarize the central ideas and approach of this course. These ideas provide a framework with which to categorize the core concepts.</p>

<h3>Mechanics: The Study of Motion</h3>

<p>Newtonian Mechanics is the study of motion and how forces change this motion. </p>

<h3>Two Basic Types of Motion and Objects</h3>

<p>This course involves only two types of motion:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Translational (Linear) Motion - the movement of a particle (or the center of mass) from one place to another.</li>
	<li>Rotational Motion - the rotation of a rigid body.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two types of motion pertain to two types of objects: point particles, and rigid bodies. The motion of more complex objects like deformable solids and liquids may be deduced by dividing them into small pieces before applying the laws and concepts of this course, but such treatments are omitted in favor of fundamentals.</p>

<h3>Five Basic Descriptions of Motion</h3>

<p>Each of the two basic types of motion can be described using any one of five physical quantities as variables to describe the state of motion of the system:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Velocity (or Angular Velocity for Rotational Motion)</li>
	<li>Momentum (or Angular Momentum for Rotational Motion)</li>
	<li>Mechanical Energy</li>
</ul>

<p>These basic descriptions are fundamental organizing principles of mechanics, and they underlie the Core Models used in our MAPS (Modeling Applied to Problem Solving) approach to mechanics. </p>

<p>These motion variables will remain constant if the system experiences no interactions. Newton’s First Law is an example of this – that the velocity of a point particle will remain constant if no forces act on it. Angular Momentum about some axis will remain constant if there is not external torque about that axis.</p>

<h3>Four Common Types of Interaction</h3>

<p>Interactions are central in mechanics because they generate forces that change the variables that describe motion. For example, gravity generates weight, which can change mechanical energy and other motion variables. </p>

<p>This course will generally consider only these four common types of interaction: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Gravitational interaction, both universal and uniform,</li>
	<li>Contact interactions, when two bodies touch,</li>
	<li>Tension interactions, such as in a string, and</li>
	<li>Elastic Restoring interactions, as with a spring.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is a Core Physical Model?</h3>

<p>A physical model is a simplified representation of structure and behavior in a physical system.</p>

<p>In this course the core physical models involve systems composed of one or more particles or solid bodies (the structure), and describe how forces change some physical variable like the momentum (the behavior). For example, the momentum model describes how external forces change the momentum of a collection of particles.</p>

<p>The solution to a physical problem is also a physical model, with attendant simplifications and assumptions. Often it will contain one or more core physical models.</p>

<h3>Models vs. Formulae</h3>
<p>The equation 4 = 3 + 1 represents a mathematical truth. The equation F = ma is not a mathematical truth. It represents how the world works <i>in certain circumstances with certain assumptions</i> – it is a model of the world that is not complete. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the F above is not the same F as in the momentum model, F = dp/dt, where F refers only to <i>external forces</i>. In F = ma, the F is the <i>net force</i>. In addition, F = ma applies only to single particles, whereas F = dp/dt can apply to a collection of point particles. Thus these equations are not true in and of themselves. Rather they apply only in conjunction with other stipulations and assumptions. We use the term "model" for the collection of stipulations and assumptions that accompany the equation. These equations are the <i>equation of change</i> of their respective models, not mathematical truths.</p>

<p>Side note: in fact, all models in this course apply only in an inertial coordinate system, for objects moving at speeds much less than the velocity of light, and under the assumption that space is not curved - so they fail near a black hole. More importantly, they fail at small distance scales where quantum effects become important; as nanotechnology advances this is becoming of major concern. </p>

<p>One key to becoming more expert is to understand that these equations are not stand-alone formulae, but are each the heart of a model that specifies the definitions, circumstances of applicability, and assumptions that accompany the application of the formulae to the physical world. It is only by internalizing the key ideas of the model (applicable systems, what interactions cause the change, assumptions, etc. ) that you will be able to understand and figure out when a particular model is applicable to the particular physical situation at hand.</p>
