<h2>Overview of MAPS</h2>

<p>Modeling Applied to Problem Solving (MAPS) organizes the standard mechanics syllabus under five core models: dynamics, momentum, energy, rotational dynamics, and angular momentum – each distinguished by the variable used to describe the motion. Each model is restricted to systems containing only certain types of objects, and only certain aspects of the forces change the motion variable of that model. </p>

<p>A graphical overview of the models of motion is presented above. Each core model occupies one column, with the <i>allowed <b>systems</b></i> and <i>motion variable</i> near the top, the types of <b>interaction</b> and the particular aspect of the forces that acts as an <i>agent of change,</i> and the <i>equation of change</i> underneath.  Each model will be described in at least one of the introductory units of the course. Those units will begin by highlighting the portion of the core model map that is covered in that unit.</p>

<p>The next page introduces the central idea of MAPS – that organizing one’s knowledge of mechanics using <i>models</i> enables a <i>modeling</i> process to conceptualize the solution of new problems in terms of existing models. In the subsequent page, we will discuss the procedure for making this connection: approaching the problem by identifying the System and the Interactions as a guide to identifying the appropriate Model (SIM). </p>
