                        <p>Weight is an important force acting on every object near the earth's surface.  Motion dominated by the influence of the weight force is called freefall.
</p>
<h4> Learning Goals</h4>
<p>After working through this module you should be able to:
</p>
<ul><li> Define freefall.
</li><li> Define <i>g</i> as it pertains to near-earth gravity.
</li><li> Describe the acceleration of any object moving under the influence of only its weight.
</li></ul>
<h2> The Acceleration of Gravity</h2>
<p>The weight of any object near the earth is a downward force equal to the object's mass times <i>g</i>, where:
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{}g = \mbox{9.8 m/s}^{2}$</m>
</p><p>An object which is moving under the influence of <b>only</b> its weight (no other interactions are significant) is said to be in <b>freefall</b>.  For an object near the earth subject only to the force of gravity, Newton's Second Law takes an extremely simple form:
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{} mg = F_{net} = ma$</m>
</p><p>implying that the size of the acceleration will be:
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{} a = g = \mbox{9.8 m/s}^{2}$</m>
</p><p>and the acceleration will be directed <b>downward</b>.  Thus, freefall near the earth's surface is an example of motion with constant acceleration.  Freefall is an excellent approximation to the motion of heavy objects thrown or dropped near the earth's surface.  Thus, understanding freefall was a very important step in the history of mechanics.  The fact that freefall near the earth's surface is motion with constant acceleration is one reason for the central place the <!--<a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#OneDimensional_Motio" name="OneDimensional_Motio" onclick="domath()">-->One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration<!--</a>--> Model holds in the mechanics curriculum.

<h2> Illustrative Example:  Keys Please</h2>
<p>A college student with a third floor dorm room is exiting the dorm when he suddenly realizes he has forgotten his keys. Rather than run back to the room, he calls his roommate and goes to stand under the dorm room window. The roommate brings the keys to the window.  The following problems relate to this situation.

<tr style="display:none" id="ht7">
<td> <div class="floatright"><img src="../Unit5/Module4/files/Keysprojectile.gif" /></div>
<p>A technique that is commonly useful in problems involving freefall with an upward initial velocity is to divide the trajectory at the point of maximum height.  The position of maximum height is useful because the velocity goes to zero there. 
</p><p>We therefore begin by analyzing the portion of the trajectory shown in blue in the figure.  For this portion of the trajectory, the final velocity is zero.  We can therefore find the time elapsed during the upward (blue) portion by using the simplest mathematical representation of the Model:
</p><p><m>$ \mathcal{}v(t) = v_{i,y} + a_{y}(t-t_{i}) $</m>
</p><p>which becomes
</p><p><m>$ \mathcal{} 0 = v_{i,y} + a_{y}t_{peak}$</m>
</p><p>giving
</p><p><m>$  \mathcal{}t_{peak} = \frac{-v_{i,y}}{a_{y}}$</m>
</p><p>(again, remember that the acceleration is negative in this problem).
</p><p>The time for the downward (red) portion of the motion is not as straightforward.  We know the initial velocity is zero, but we do not know the final velocity <i>or</i> the total height (the keys have reached a height greater than the initial 5 m by the time the downward motion begins).  We can easily find either of these quantities.  Here, we choose to find the height of the peak by evaluating
</p><p><m>$ \mathcal{} y_{peak} = y_{i} + \frac{1}{2}(v_{i,y}+v_{peak,y})(t_{peak}-t_{i})$</m>
</p><p>for the upward motion to find
</p><p><m>$ \mathcal{} y_{peak} = y_{i} + \frac{1}{2}v_{i,y}t_{peak} $</m>
</p><p>and substituting our result for t<sub>peak</sub>, we have
</p><p><m>$ \mathcal{} y_{peak} = y_{i} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{v_{i,y}^{2}}{a_{y}}$</m>
</p><p>We can now find the time elapsed during the downward motion by using exactly the same procedures as in Part A, except that we have a different initial height:
</p><p><m>$  \mathcal{}0 = y_{peak} + \frac{1}{2}a_{y}(t_{f}-t_{peak})^{2}$</m>
</p><p>so
</p><p><m>$ \mathcal{} t_{f} = t_{peak} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-2y_{peak}}{a_{y}}} $</m>
</p><p>Only the plus sign makes sense here, because the time to fall must be nonzero.  Substituting our values for t and y at the peak gives:
</p><p><m>$ \mathcal{} t_{f} = \frac{-v_{i,y}}{a_{y}} + \sqrt{\frac{2y_{i} + v_{i,y}^{2}/a_{y}}{a_{y}}} = \mbox{1.4 s}$</m>
</p><p>The same answer as we obtained using Method 1.

<td> Again, we present two separate but equivalent ways to do this problem.  The first method again requires the quadratic equation but is faster.  The second method requires more steps and stronger insight.

</p><p>The only difference is that the initial velocity here is <i>negative</i> 3.3 m/s instead of positive 3.3 m/s.  Thus, we find:

<th> Method 2: Using Final Velocity
 [<a href="javascript:toggleDisplay('ht10','hide','show')" id="ht10l">show</a>]</th></tr>
<tr style="display:none" id="ht10">
<td> This time, the motion has no peak point at which the keys are turning around (keys thrown downward will only <i>speed up</i>, they will not slow to zero like keys thrown upward).  Thus, we cannot break up the motion as we did in Part B. Instead, we use a two step process. It is very valuable in freefall (and projectile) problems to know the initial and final velocities. In this case, we only have the initial velocity as a given, but we can find the final velocity as a first step toward solving the problem. To do this, we must recognize that without time the only Law of Change for our model that can be solved for the final velocity is:
<p><m>$\mathcal{} v_{f,y}^{2} = v_{i,y}^{2} + 2a_{y}(y_{f}-y_{i})$</m>
</p><p>Using our standard coordinates, this becomes:
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{} v_{f,y} = \pm \sqrt{v_{i,y}^{2} - 2a_{y} y_{i}}$</m>
</p><p>In this case, the <i>minus</i> sign must be chosen, because we know that the keys are moving <i>downward</i> when they reach the forgetful student's hand.  Thus,
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{} v_{f,y} = - \sqrt{v_{i,y}^{2} - 2a_{y}y_{i}} $</m>
</p><p>Once the final velocity is known, we can turn to the simple equation:
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{} v_{y}(t) = v_{i,y} + a_{y}(t-t_{i}) $</m>
</p><p>which becomes:
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{} v_{f,y} = v_{i,y} + a_{y}t_{f} $</m>
</p><p>giving:
</p><p><m>$\mathcal{} t_{f} = \frac{v_{f,y} - v_{i,y}}{a_{y}} = \frac{-v_{i,y}-\sqrt{v_{i,y}^{2} -2a_{y}y_{i}}}{a_{y}} = \mbox{0.73 s}$</m>
</p><p>The same answer as was obtained using Method 1.
</p><p><b>Challenge:</b> As a final Method of solving Part C, can you show that you obtain the same answer by using the answer to Part B and subtracting the time that the keys spend above y = 5 m?
