<h2>Newton's Third Law</h2>

<p>Newton's Third Law is really a law of force. It says that each physical interaction occurs between two objects and produces a force on each object. Further, it states that those forces are opposite in direction.</p>

<h3>Learning Goals</h3>

<p>After completing this module you should be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>State Newton's Third Law.</li>
	<li>Explain how Newton's Third Law implies that all interactions must involve two objects.</li>
	<li>Use double subscript notation to indicate the pair of objects whose interaction produces a given force.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Statement of the Law</h3>

<p><b>Newton's Third Law</b>, as translated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Motte">Motte</a>:

<p><i>To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual action of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press on a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone.</i></p>

<p>The phrase after the colon is often omitted, but is of utmost importance because it emphasizes that two forces come from every single interaction, and that they act on two different objects. We call this resulting pair of forces a third-law pair (sometimes it is referred to as an action-reaction pair). Thus, every force produced on a given body is always accompanied by an equal and opposite force exerted on the (different) body that is the interaction partner. This law is sometimes called the "two-body rule."</p>
