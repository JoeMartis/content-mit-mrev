<h3> Interactions and Force</h3>

		<td>Forces arise any time two objects interact with each other. As an example, consider the situation where a person is pushing a box with one hand. There is an interaction between the hand and the box because these two objects are in <i>contact</i> with each other. As a result of this interaction, the hand exerts a force on the box and the box exerts a force on the hand. These contact forces, which may be normal (perpendicular) or parallel to the contact surface of each object, are the result of a complex physical mechanism between the electrons at or near the surface of both objects. This physical mechanism is what we call the contact interaction between these two objects.</td>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this course to understand the physical mechanisms that take place during every interaction, but this is not required for understanding the macroscopic characteristics of the forces that result. One of the objectives of a working understanding of mechanics at the macroscopic scale is the ability to use these ideas to create models of microscopic systems. </p>

<p>In the next unit we will discuss the four categories of interactions that we will encounter in this course:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gravitational Interactions: gravitational force</li>
	<li>Elastic restoring interaction: spring force</li>
	<li>Tension interactions: tension in a rope</li>
	<li>Contact Interactions (normal forces, kinetic and static friction forces)</li>
</ul>
