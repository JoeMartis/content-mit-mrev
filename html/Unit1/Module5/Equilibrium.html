<h2>
Equilibrium: Acceleration is zero.</h2>
<p>
			Newton's First Law will apply whenever the <i>vector sum</i> of all forces acting on an object is zero.</p>
<h3>
Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
			After completing this module you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				Define translational equilibrium.</li>
<li>
				State the most general conditions for Newton's First Law to apply to the motion of an object.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
			Applying the First AND Second Laws</h3>
<p>
			What evidence is there of interaction forces when there is <b>no change</b> in motion? If we observe accelerations of some or all parts of a system (or object), then we infer the presence of unbalanced forces from Newton's 2nd Law. Deformation of a rubber ball when it hits the floor is evidence of a force on the rubber ball (by the floor); similarly, the change in velocity of the ball when it hits the floor is evidence of this same force acting on the ball. A trickier example is an object at rest, where we observe zero acceleration. (We assume here and in what follows that our frame of reference is inertial.)</p>
<p>
			When the net force on an object is zero, the object is said to be in <b>translational equilibrium</b>, meaning that the translational motion will not change. In this case, Newton's First Law applies.</p>
<p>
			We can invert this argument: if an object is moving with constant velocity (or, as a special case, if an object is at rest) then the forces acting on that object must add up to zero. This is the first place where the consequence of the vector nature of forces is truly evident.</p>
<p>
<b>Equilibrium Condition in Vector Notation</b></p>
<p>
\( \vec{F}_{net} = \sum \vec{F} = 0\)</p>
<p>
			It is important to remember that force is a vector, which is what the arrows above the <i>F</i> symbols in the equilibrium equation denote. Vectors are a mathematical way to account for quantities that have three distinct components in 3 dimensional space (x,y,z). Vectors are quantities that have relative magnitude (size) AND point in some particular direction. Because of this, the equilibrium condition that the net force be zero is actually three separate identical conditions, one for each direction in space. Each direction can be considered alone, so three equilibrium equations must hold simultaneously. For each direction the sum of the components of the forces in that direction must equal zero. (Recall, having multiple simultaneously true equations allows for solving problems with multiple unknowns. Recognizing that <i>one</i> vector equation is equivalent to <i>multiple simultaneous</i> equations is very useful.)</p>
<p>
			Thankfully, the concise way to express the condition for equilibrium is:</p>
<p>
<b>Equilibrium Condition in Component Notation</b></p>
<p>
\( F_{net,x} = \sum F_{x} = 0 \)</p>
<p>
<b>and</b></p>
<p>
\( F_{net,y} = \sum F_{y} = 0 \)</p>
<p>
<b>and</b></p>
<p>
\( F_{net,z} = \sum F_{z} = 0 \)</p>
<p>
<br/>
			Because two directions are sufficient for understanding most of translational mechanics, our examples and discussions will primarily focus on 1D and 2D motion. We will add the third dimension when it is absolutely necessary to understand the physics.</p>
