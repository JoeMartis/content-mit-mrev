    <title>CheckPoint: Newton's 2nd Law 1</title>
    
      <p><h3>Check Your Understanding of Newton's Second Law</h3>
Suppose an object is initially at rest when it is suddenly acted on by two forces.  A large force acts due north on the object and a smaller force acts due east.  What is the direction of the object's acceleration?<br/> </p>

Incorrect. Newton's 2nd Law says that the acceleration of the object will be in the direction of the <b>total</b> force.  Thus, the eastward force will also affect the acceleration.

Correct. Imagine the two forces as the legs of a right triangle.  The northward leg is longer.  Thus, the hypotenuse will point closer to north than to east.
