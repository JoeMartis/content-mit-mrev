<h2><b>Newton's Laws of Motion</b></h2>
<br/>
<h3><b>Unit Summary</b></h3>
Mechanics is the study of motion and those significant physical interactions that cause changes in motion.  Common observations about how things move and questions about what is required for motion to change are natural starting points for a coherent and verifiable understanding of the physical world. In contrast to the many brilliant thinkers who lived before him, Newton wrote down the first basically correct description of the cause of changes in motion in his Laws of Motion. Their "correctness" is verified by their powerful ability to predict the future motions based on known interactions. Thus the first great synthesis of the modern science of mechanics was made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>. </p>
<p>Newton's three laws describe (1) the key intrinsic property that constrains the observable changes in motion of objects, (2) the relationship between the forces exerted on an object and its resulting motion change, as well as (3) the fundamentals of all interactions between two objects. These laws lead to the concepts of momentum, energy, and angular momentum, the other  physical quantities essential to the study of mechanics.  </p>
<p>Problem solving starts with identifying all the interactions between a system and the surroundings; so in this unit we start with interaction laws and some simple ways to symbolically describe these heady ideas. 
</p>
<br/>
<h3> Learning Goals For This Unit</h3>
<p>After completing this unit you should be able to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Give a definition of the term "interaction"</li>
	<li>Add vectors and write a vector in its x and y components</li>
	<li>Define the net force in terms of the individual forces</li>
	<li>Define the term "free body diagram"</li>
	<li>Use double subscript notation to indicate the pair of interacting objects</li>
	<li>State Newton's Laws </li>
</ul>
