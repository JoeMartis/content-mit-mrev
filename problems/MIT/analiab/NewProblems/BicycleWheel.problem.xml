      <p>
A bicycle wheel of radius R and mass m has moment of inertia Icm about an axis passing perpendicular to the plane of the wheel
and through the center-of-mass. The bicycle wheel is initially spinning with angular velocity \(\omega_o\) about the center-of-mass. 
The wheel is lowered to the ground without bouncing. As soon as the wheel touches the level ground, the wheel starts to accelerate
forward until it begins to roll without slipping with an unknown final angular velocity \(\omega^f\) 
   and an unknown center-of-mass velocity \(v_{cm}^{f}\) .

 Find the center-of-mass velocity  \(v_{cm}^{f}\) when the wheel rolls without slipping.
 </p><p> Assume that the moment 
 of inertia of the wheels is approximately \(I_{cm}=mR^2 \). Express your answer in some or all of the variables R, m, \(\omega_o\). Type omega_o for \(\omega_o\).
