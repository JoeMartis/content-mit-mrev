<p>

Two beads of mass \(m\) are constrained to move along two horizontal frictionless rails that make an angle  \(2\theta \) with respect to each other. They 
are connected by a spring with spring constant k. What is the frequency of oscillations for the motion where the two beads always stay parallel to each 
other (ie: the distance between the meeting point of the rails and each particle is equal)?
In your answer type theta for \(\theta\).
