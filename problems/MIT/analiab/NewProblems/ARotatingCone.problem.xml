A small block with mass <i>m</i> is placed inside an inverted cone that is rotating about a vertical axis such that the time for one
 revolution of the cone is T as shown in the figure. The walls of the cone make an angle \(\beta\)  with the vertical. The coefficient
  of static friction between the block and the cone is \(\mu_s\). The goal of the problem is to find the magnitude of the force of
   friction \(F_{fr}\) between the block and the cone's wall if the block is to remain at a constant height  h above the apex
   of the cone.

In your solution clearly indicate:
<br/>
<p>The <b>system</b> that you consider and the <b>interactions</b> between the object(s) in the system and external objects. 
Draw the resulting forces in a FBD. Indicate the coordinate system that you will use to describe the vectors. Include in your solutions the <b>model(s)</b> that you use.

 <p>
What is the magnitude of the force of friction? (Note: the double bars in the expressions below indicate the absolute value).
