A sports company that manufactures skiing equipment is interested in determining the coefficient of friction between two surfaces. Your group, as part 
of an interview process for a lucrative contract with the sports company, is asked to solve the following problem: 

A bob of mass m1, at the end of a string of length l swings down from a horizontal starting position and hits a box of mass m2. The bob is assumed 
to stop when it hits the box, and the box slides across the horizontal surface. You measure that the box travels a distance d along a straight line 
before it stops. Your task is to determine the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the surface. Express your answer in terms of m1, m2, l, d 
and the gravitational acceleration g as required.
