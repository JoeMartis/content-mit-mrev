Two cylinders of radius and moment of inertia \(R_1\), \(R_2\), \(I_1\) and \(I_2\), respectively, are supported by their axes perpendicular to the plane. The large 
cylinder is initially rotating with angular velocity \(\omega\). The small cylinder is moved to the right against the larger cylinder and after 
slipping stops they both start to rotate in opposite direction at a constant rate.

Find \(\omega_1\), the angular velocity of the smaller cylinder, at the instant when the cylinders are rotating without slipping.
Assume that \(R_2 = 2R_1\) and that the mass of the large disk is 3 times larger than the mass of the smaller one. In your answer enter w for \(\omega\).
