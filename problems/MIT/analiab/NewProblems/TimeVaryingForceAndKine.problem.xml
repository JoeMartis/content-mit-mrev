A particle of mass <i>m</i> is moving with a constant velocity \(\vec{v}_o = v_o\hat{i}\). At time t = 0 it enters a region between two plates
that are separated by a distance <i>h</i> and are contained in the x-z plane as shown in the figure. The particle is acting on by both gravity and by a time varying force that points 
 upward (along the +y - direction) and has a magnitude <i>F = bt</i>, where <i>b</i> is a positive constant and is large enough such that the particle never touches the plates.

<p> <b>Part 1.</b> Do a qualitative plot of the particle's position as a function of time. This will help you to to visualize the particle's motion and to plan your solution.
<br/>
</p> 
<p><b>Part 2.</b> If the particle is initially at the midpoint between the two plates (as shown in the figure above), how long does it take for the particle to reach its lowest point? <br/>
