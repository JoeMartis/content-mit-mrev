An airliner made an emergency landing at the Los Angeles airport with its nose wheel locked in a position perpendicular to its normal rolling
position. The horizontal component of the planeâ€™s velocity at touchdown is an unknown quantity <i>vo</i> . The forces acting to stop 
the airliner arose from friction due to the nose wheel and the braking  effort of the engine in reverse thrust mode. The sum of horizontal forces
can be modeled as
<br/>

\( F_{horiz}(t) = -Fo + Bt\)
<br/>
from touchdown at t = 0 until the plane comes to rest at  t = <i>ts</i> . Assume the mass of the plane is <i>m</i>. The goal of this problem is 
to figure how far the plane traveled from touchdown until it came to a stop. Express your answer in terms of some or all of the known quantities: 
<i> Fo</i> , <i>B</i>, <i>ts</i> , <i>m</i> but not in terms of <i>vo</i>. For Fo type (Fo).
<br/>
<i>In your solution, clearly indicate the system(s) that you will consider, the coordinate system to describe the motion
and the kinematic model(s) you will use. </i>
