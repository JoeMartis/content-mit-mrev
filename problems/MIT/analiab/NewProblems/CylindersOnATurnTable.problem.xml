Two metal cylinders of mass m1 and m2 are placed one at the top of the other on a circular turntable that is rotating at a constant 
speed as illustrated in the diagram. The coefficient of static friction between the lower cylinder and the turntable is  
\(\mu_1\) and the coefficient of static friction between the cylindersâ€™ surfaces is 
\(\mu_2\). The cylinders remain at rest with respect to the turntable and are at a distance R from its center.
What is the maximum angular speed  \(\omega_{max}\) that the turntable can rotate for which 
the two cylinders remain at rest with respect to the turntable? (Assume that mu1 is smaller than mu2)

<i>In your solution clearly indicate</i>:
<br/>
<p><i>The <b>system</b> that you consider and the <b>interactions</b> between the object(s) in the system and external objects. 
Draw the resulting forces in a FBD. Indicate the coordinate system that you will use to describe the vectors. Include in your solutions
the <b>model(s)</b> that you use.

<p>Express your answer in terms of some or all of the variables given: R, m1, m2, \(\mu_1\), 
and \(\mu_2\). Enter g for the magnitude of the acceleration
due to gravity and mu1 and mu2 for \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\).
