<p>You can encounter a situation where a system constituted by more than one extended object. To find the center of mass of a system of this kind:</p>

<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
	<li> Replace each of the extended objects by a point particle. </li>
	<li> The mass of each point particle is the mass of the corresponding extended object. </li>
	<li> The position of each point particle is the position of the center of mass of the corresponding object.</li>
</ul>

<p>This procedure is summarized in the figure below: Calculate the center of mass (CM) of the system formed by two square boxes, the lower one with a mass twice as the mass of the upper box.</p>
