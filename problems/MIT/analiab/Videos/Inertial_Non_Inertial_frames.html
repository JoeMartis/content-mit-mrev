<br/>
<p>
A <b> frame of reference </b> is a coordinate system (e.g. an orthogonal set of axes) relative to which we describe the motion of an object. If the motion of the object relative to a given frame of reference obeys Newton's first law, then the frame of reference is called an <i><b>inertial frame of reference</b></i>. All inertial frames of references are moving at a constant speed with respect to each other. A frame of reference in which Newton's first law does not hold is called a <i><b>non-inertial frame of reference</b></i>. An accelerating frame of reference is non-inertial.</p>
<br/>
<hr/>
<p>	To understand the meaning of the definition of an inertial and non-inertial frame of references, watch the following short movies taken from the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/frames_of_reference">PSSC film '' Frame of Reference'', 1960</a>. Produced by Richard Leacock and narrated by University of Toronto professors Donald Ivey and Patterson Hume.</p>

<p>In the following movies the motion of a ball is filmed with a camera fixed to a table. In the movie to the left the cart is at rest with respect to the table. In the movie to the right the cart is moving at a constant velocity relative to the table.</p>

<font size="3"><b>The cart moving at a constant velocity vs. the accelerating cart</b></font>
<p>		A slow motion camera attached to the cart is used to film the path followed by the ball. In the left movie the cart is moving at a constant velocity with respect to the table. In the right movie the cart is moving with a constant acceleration.

As in the case of the cart at rest, the path followed by the ball
as viewed from an observer in the cart is parallel to the rod. 
The ball lands at the bottom of the rod. An observer in the 
moving frame is unable to tell that the frame is moving.    
<td>
When the cart is accelerating, the path followed by the ball as
viewed from an observer in the cart is a straight line at an 
angle with respect to the rod. The ball lands to the left of the
bottom of the rod. An observer in the moving frame concludes
that Newton's first law does not hold.</td>

<b>Note:</b><br/>
<p>	The Earth is the most common frame of which we observe the motion of an object. At a first approximation we can neglect the rotation of the Earth about its axis and treat its instantaneous motion around the sun as translational (straight-line) motion at a constant speed. In this approximation the Earth is an inertial frame of reference.</p>
