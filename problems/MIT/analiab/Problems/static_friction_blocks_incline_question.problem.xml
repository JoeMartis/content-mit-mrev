        a) Two blocks with the same mass <i>m</i> are both at rest on an a surface at an 
        angle <i>alpha;</i> with respect to the horizontal as shown. One 
        is made of plastic and the other is made of rubber. The coefficient of static 
        friction of the rubber is larger than the one of plastic. When the angle of 
        the incline increases, which of the objects will move first? 
        <optioninput name="Foil1" options="('the rubber block','the plastic block','both move at the same time')" correct="the plastic block">

        b) The two blocks are now made of the same plastic material but one has twice 
        the mass than the other.  When the angle increases which of the blocks move 
        first?

        c) The blocks are identical, same mass and same material, but they are placed 
        on the incline in such a way that one has a smaller surface area in contact 
        with than the other. When the angle is increased which one moves first?
        <optioninput name="Foil3" options="('the one having a smaller surface area in contact','the one having a larger surface area in contact','both move at the same time')" correct="both move at the same time">
