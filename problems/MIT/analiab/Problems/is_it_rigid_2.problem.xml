        <p>The object shown below is rotating about a pivot point. The velocity is shown at two different points on the object. Is this object a rigid body?</p>

                It is impossible to tell whether this is a rigid body.

            <p>In a rotating rigid object, the entire object rotates with the same angular velocity around its pivot point. The two points shown have the same angular velocities about the pivot point, so it is possible that this object could be rigid. However, it is also possible that this object could be non-rigid, and have the appropriate velocities for an instant only by coincidence. A single "snapshot" like this cannot tell us for certain.</p>
