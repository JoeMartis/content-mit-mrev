    <title> CheckPoint: Conservation of Momentum 2</title>
    <p>Pendulum 1 is released from an elevated position at \(t=0\). It swings downward and collides inelastically with pendulum 2 which is at rest before the collision. Both pendula then swing upward together, reaching the top point of the swing at \(t = t_{3}\) .</p>

    <p>Let's define \(t_{1}\) to be the instant right before the collision, and \(t_2\) to be the instant right after the collision. </p>

    <p>Assuming that the collision happens nearly instantaneously, \(t_2 \approx t_1 \), for the system that includes both pendula, the momentum is conserved: </p>
