    <title> CheckPoint: Conservation of Momentum</title>
    
      <p>Two blocks of different masses are connected by a spring and placed on a horizontal and frictionless table as shown. A rope is used to keep the blocks at rest and the spring compressed a distance d. After cutting the rope the spring expands and pushes the blocks away from each other.

Consider two moments in time: before cutting the rope and after cutting it. Between these two moments, the momentum is conserved for:
