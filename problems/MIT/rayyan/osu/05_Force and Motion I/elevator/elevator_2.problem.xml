      <p><br/>
Starting from rest, an elevator accelerates uniformly between the 1st and 2nd floors, and decelerates uniformly between the 5th and 6th floors, coming to a stop at the 6th floor. Between the 2nd and 5th floors, the elevator covers the 6 meter distance between two adjacent floors in 1 second.  Inside, Liz (who is about to graduate) is standing on a scale that reads 800 N when the elevator isn't moving. What was her minimum scale reading during the trip? Use g = 10 m/s^2.
