    <p>Two vehicles, one of mass M and the other of mass 2M, are moving in the same direction on a highway. Both drivers apply their brakes at the same time and both vehicles begin sliding. If the coefficient of kinetic friction \(\mu_{k}\) is the same for both vehicles, how do their accelerations a<sub>1</sub> and a<sub>2</sub> compare?</p>
