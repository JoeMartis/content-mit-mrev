      <p>
Suppose there were a planet with exactly the same density as earth, but with a radius 
half as great as the Earth's radius. The mass of a uniform sphere is given by 
\(M=(4/3)\pi\)\(r^3\)\(\rho\), where \(\rho\) 
is the density of the sphere. What would be the ratio of \(g_p/g_E\) for 
the gravity on this planet compared to gravity on earth?  Note that the mass of the planet 
would be 8 times smaller than earth.
