A satellite of mass \(m\) is in a circular orbit around the Earth with radius \(2R_E\).  A piece of 
space junk of mass \(m_j\) hits the satellite and sticks to it.  The satellite (carrying the extra mass) then falls in an 
elliptical orbit around the Earth.  Assume that the piece of junk had a negligible speed at the moment of the 
collision.  What is the maximum value of the junk mass \(m_j\) if the satellite of \(m\) is to remain in orbit without
hitting the Earth?  Write your expression in terms of \(m\).
