An engineer is in a competition to launch a pumpkin as high as possible using a launching device that must be kept within a certain height. Since the engineer has a height restriction, the engineer wants to accelerate the pumpkin to a large speed before releasing it.

<br/>

The engineer decides a good way to get the pumpkin moving fast is to attach the pumpkin to a vertical wheel turned by a motor. When the wheel is turning as fast as possible at its constant rate w, the pumpkin can be released so that it goes straight upwards. If during the competition the pumpkin reaches a height h from where it was released, what was the angular velocity w of the wheel? Use g, H, and R in your answer.<br/>
