      <p>
The shapes below represent objects that each have the same mass. The black outlined shapes have all of their mass concentrated evenly around
their perimeter. The gray shaded shapes have their mass evenly distributed.<br/>

Which of the eight shapes shown has the second greatest moment of inertia about an axis "out of the screen" that goes through the center of mass
 of the shape?
