Two engineers are working together in a competition to launch a pumpkin as high as possible using a launching device that must be kept within a certain height. Since the engineers have a height restriction, they want to accelerate the pumpkin to a large speed before releasing it. They decide a good way to get the pumpkin moving fast is to attach the pumpkin to a vertical wheel turned by a motor.<br/>

The first engineer suggests that when the wheel is turning as fast as possible at its constant rate w, the pumpkin can be released so that it goes straight upwards.<br/>

The other engineer gets out a notebook, runs through some physics calculations, and concludes that releasing the pumpkin straight up will not achieve maximum height. If the wheel spins at a constant angular velocity w, at what angle should the pumpkin be released to reach the higher distance from the ground? Use the fact that sin &#x398; &#x2248; &#x398; for small angles of &#x398;, and assume the wheel is spinning quickly. Use g, R, and W in your answer.<br/>
