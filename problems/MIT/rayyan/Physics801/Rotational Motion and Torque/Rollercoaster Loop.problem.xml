As an engineer for amusement park, you are asked to design a simple rollercoaster with an inversion (a loop). The rollercoaster will start from rest at a height of h, drop on a smooth track, enter a circular loop of radius r, and then return to the station. You want the riders' perceived weight at the top of the loop to be $n mg (also known as a g-force of $n). What must h be in terms of r? Assume there is no friction or air resistance.
