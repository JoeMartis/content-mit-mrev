      <p>
A block of mass M sits at rest on a frictionless table; the block has a circular surface of radius R as shown in the figure. A small cube of mass m and speed v is incident upon the block; the cube moves without friction on the table and the block.
<br/>
What is the maximum height h above the table that is reached by the cube?
<br/>
Assume v is small enough so that h &lt; R.
<br/>
\(h =\)
