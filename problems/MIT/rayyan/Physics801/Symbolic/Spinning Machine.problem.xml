A drum of mass ma and radius a rotates freely with initial angular velocity \(\omega_a\) 
(type in as omega_a). A second drum with mass mb and radius b &gt; a is mounted on the same axle and is
at rest, although it is free to rotate. A thin layer of sand is distributed on
the inner surface of the smaller drum. At t = 0, small perforations in the inner drum are
opened. The sand starts to fly out at a constant rate s kg/s and sticks to the outer drum.

<br/>
Find the subsequent angular velocity of drum \(\omega_b\) as a function of time. Ignore the transit time of the sand. 
<br/>
\(\omega_b =\)
