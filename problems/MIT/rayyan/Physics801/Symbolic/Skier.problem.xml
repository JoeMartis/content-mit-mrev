An experienced skier knows how to gain speed while skiing over a small dips of snow. The trick is to jump in the air and land smoothly on the slope downward. <br/>
Here a skier traveling at velocity v wants to jump up and smoothly land on a dip that makes an angle b with the horizontal. For what distance d back from the dip should the skier jump up into the air in order to make smooth landing?

Use g for the gravitational constant. <br/>
