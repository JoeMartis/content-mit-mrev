A ribbon of negligible mass is wound around a spool of mass M, radius R, and moment of
inertia I about the center of mass. The ribbon is tightly wound so that it will not slip relative
to the spool. The spool lies on its side on a frictionless horizontal surface and is initially at
rest. Starting at t = 0 a constant force of magnitude F in the x direction is applied to the
free end of the ribbon. Find the displacement x of the center of mass of the spool after a
length L of the ribbon has unwound from the spool. Express your answer in terms of M, R,
I, and L.
