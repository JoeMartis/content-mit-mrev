        <p>
Two blocks of equal masses are placed on a horizontal table as shown. The bottom block is then pulled with a slowly increasing horizontal force \(F\). Both contact surfaces (between the bottom block and the table <b>and</b> between the two blocks) are frictionless. 
<br/>Select the correct description of the motion of the blocks. <b>Note: "move" or "does not move" refers to the laboratory ("Earth") frame of reference.</b>
