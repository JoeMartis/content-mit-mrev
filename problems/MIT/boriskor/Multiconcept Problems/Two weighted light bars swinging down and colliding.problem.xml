<p>Two light bars have lengths of \(l\) and \(2l\). There are small masses \(m\) and \(2m\), attached to the free ends of the bars as shown. The bars are pivoted at the common frictionless hinge as shown. Initially, the bars are held horizontally. The bars are released from the horizontal position in such a way that they collide, inelastically, at the bottom position. After that, the bars swing upward together. Find the maximum angle \(\theta\) the bars would make with the vertical after the collision. </p>
