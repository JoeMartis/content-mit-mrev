      <p>
A system consists of two blocks, of masses \(M\) and \(m\), connected by a light string passing over a frictionless pulley. Initially, the system is at rest because of friction between block \(M\) and the horizontal surface. Then block m is pulled sideways until the string makes angle \(\theta\) with the vertical and then released. Block \(M\) begins to slide at the very moment block \(m\) passes through its original position. Find the coefficient of static friction \(\mu_s\) between block M and the horizontal surface.
