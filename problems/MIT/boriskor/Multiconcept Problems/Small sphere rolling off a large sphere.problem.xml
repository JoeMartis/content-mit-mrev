A heavy sphere of radius r=1.00 meter is at rest on the ground. A small uniform solid sphere is placed at the top of the larger sphere. After a slight disturbance, the smaller sphere begins to roll downward without slipping. How high h is the small sphere above the ground at the instant it loses contact with the large sphere?
