        <p>
Two blocks of equal masses are placed on a horizontal table as shown. The top block is then pulled with a slowly increasing horizontal force \(F\). The coefficient of static friction for the top surface is greater than zero and the bottom surface is frictionless.<br/>
Select the correct description of the motion of the blocks. <b>Note: "move" or "does not move" refers to the laboratory ("Earth") frame of reference.</b>

                The top block begins to move as soon as F reaches a certain minimum value; the bottom block does not begin to move at that instant but would begin to move as F increases further.
