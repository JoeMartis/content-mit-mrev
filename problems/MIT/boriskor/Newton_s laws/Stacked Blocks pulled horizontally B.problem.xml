        <p>
Two blocks of equal masses are placed on a horizontal table as shown. The top block is then pulled with a slowly increasing horizontal force \(F\). The contact surfaces between the bottom block and the table <b>and</b> between the two blocks are frictionless.<br/>
Select the correct description of the motion of the blocks. <b>Note: "move" or "does not move" refers to the laboratory ("Earth") frame of reference..</b>
