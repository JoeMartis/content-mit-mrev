<h2> Why Newtonian Mechanics - Homage to Newton</h2>
<p>Look up a typically trite list of "100 People who changed the World" and you'll generally find only one person at the very top of the list who is not the founder of religion:the scientist Isaac Newton - the creator of Newtonian mechanics, which is also called "classical mechanics."  Let us briefly discuss several of the reasons highlight his contributions so far above those of Archimedes, Einstein, or Maxwell (who completed and formalized the field of Electricity and Magnetism much as Newton did Classical Mechanics).
</p>
<h3> Intellectual Accomplishment</h3>
<p>Newton&#8217;s intellectual creation was a unique combination and extension of two powerful intellectual realms of his time that has the grandeur of a huge and stately edifice.   
</p><p>During the Renaissance Boyle, Kepler, Galileo, and others created two especially powerful ideas: 
</p><p>1.	the guide to truth in natural philosophy was to be reproducible observations, and
</p><p>2.	that this truth could generally be expressed far more precisely mathematically than by verbal argument.  
</p><p>Newton&#8217;s <b>Philosophi&#230; Naturalis Principia Mathematica</b> (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) fuses these two ideas together to create something new - <i>mathematical physics</i>.   Instead of using mathematics to describe some relationship present in the observed world, as had Galileo and Kepler, Newton followed the form of the most widely revered mathematics of his era - Euclid&#8217;s Geometry.  He started from a few definitions and axioms  - his three laws of motion &#8211; and derived a set of related laws that cover an entire realm of phenomena in the natural world.  This realm &#8211; classical mechanics &#8211; describes and predicts how forces cause the motion of classical objects.  
</p><p>The validity of his axioms and logic is then probed by testing their predictions against observation.  The result: a theory that can describe motions over immense changes of scale: from paramecia to superclusters of galaxies, and from nanoseconds to the millennia over which two galaxies collide.  It represented a first and highly successful attempt to give a mathematical theory of everything.
</p><p>Mathematical physics must not only be rigorous mathematics &#8211; it must correctly describe observations and experiments over its realm of validity and especially about the world we live in.   Here Newton triumphed over the then-known world &#8211; his laws describe the motions of the planets and their moons, comets, the tides, the precession of earth&#8217;s axis, the stability of ships and structures, why birds fly and winds blow &#8211; plus a lot more.
</p>
<h3> Changing the Intellectual World-view</h3>
<p>However impressive an intellectual creation is all by itself, we must also judge it by its intellectual impact &#8211; what widespread beliefs does it overthrow? What new ideas follow from it.  And the highest measure of all &#8211; how does it change our view of the universe and ourselves?   <i>Principia</i> passes these tests brilliantly.  It begins with the First Law overthrowing an intuitively obvious, but incorrect, view about motion held by all people who lived before Gallileo.  But most importantly, it replaced the general view that the universe was filled with many inexplicable things with the view that the universe - as well as ourselves - worked exactly as explained by the laws of mechanics.  This laid a foundation stone for the Enlightenment, also called the Age of Reason.  This view is sometimes called The Mechanical Universe (also the title of a nice set of TV lectures on physics by David Goodstein).  As Alexander Pope wrote (perhaps with an eye to Newton's other great scientific publication, <i>Optiks</i>):
</p>
<font size="3" face="euclid"><i><b>
            Nature, and Nature's laws lay hid in Night.<br/>
            God said, "Let Newton be!" And all was Light.

</b></i></font>
<p>Newton&#8217;s intellectual creation so towered above those of his contemporaries that scientists accepted Newton&#8217;s work unscientifically: there was no substantial criticism of his work for two centuries.  Indeed, the criticism by Ernst Mach - that absolute time and space were unobservable and should be replaced by perceivable quantities such as relative motion &#8211; strongly influenced Einstein's thinking as he developed his theories of Special and General Relativity.
</p>
<h3> Practical Consequences - Engineering</h3>
<p>Predicting mechanical behavior using mathematics has had its greatest impact in undergirding Engineering.  Mechanized farm machinery, textile mills, the steam engine, railroads, and steel bridges &#8211; all must be designed using Newtonian Mechanics (augmented with chemistry and materials science).   These things caused the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th century increasing the average per capita production by a factor of about 6.  In contrast, farming and animal husbandry increased it about a factor of about two relative to hunter-gatherers.  Today, Newtonian Mechanics is applied in mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering, fluid mechanics, and many parts of Civil Engineering and energy-related topics such as wind turbines and hydroelectric power.
</p>
<h2> Organizing the knowledge that You learn</h2>
<p>Learning Newtonian Mechanics means that you can solve problems involving the changes in motion of macroscopic bodies caused by familiar forces that you can perceive with your everyday senses (e.g. gravity, contact forces, tension, friction&#8230;).  In order to solve problems you need to know a limited number of facts (often involving equations), you must know certain procedures (e.g. how to draw a free body diagram), and you must know how to plan a solution. 
</p><p>In general, when students are presented with a new physics <i>problem</i> (as opposed to an <i>exercise</i>), they are not able to start solving it. They either fail to identify the proper facts and procedures needed to solve that particular problem or they are not able tie the information together to plan the solution.
</p><p>To help you with putting the information together this course is designed to provide you with an overview of mechanics and other problem solving knowledge via several routes:
</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none"><li>A <!--<a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#Hierarchy_of_Models_1" name="Hierarchy_of_Models_1" onclick="domath()">-->Hierarchy of models<!--</a>--> that summarizes the core physical concepts
</li><li>An overall concept map that stresses the relationship between the key concepts 
</li><li>By intimately integrating problem solving with presentation of new material &#8211; problem solving is an interactive process  
</li></ul>
<p>In this way, you will learn facts and procedures that will be ordered and related to each other and you will more likely succeed on starting to solve a problem that you have never seen before. ( &#8220;Brain &#8211; Bedroom analogy&#8221;: If your bedroom is messy it is in general very hard to find the right clothes for a particular activity.  However, if you have organized your bedroom in a logical manner you will find what you are looking for very easily and you might find useful things that you did not know you have stored in it).
