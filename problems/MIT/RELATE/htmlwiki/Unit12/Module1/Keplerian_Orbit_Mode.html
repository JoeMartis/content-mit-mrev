<h2>
			Kepler&#8217;s Laws</h2>
<p>
			In 1619, Johannes Kepler published <i>Harmonices Mundi </i>(Latin: The Harmony of the World) that covered harmonic proportions of regular polygons, music, astrology, and planetary motion.  The material on planets in this and earlier works constitutes what we now call <b>Kepler&#8217;s three laws</b>, although they are really four.</p>
<h3>Kepler&#8217;s Laws</h3>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
<b>1A</b> The planets move along elliptical paths, and</li>
<li>
<b>1B</b> the sun is located at one focus.</li>
<li>
<b>2</b> The planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals</li>
<li>
<b>3</b> The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. </li>
</ul>
<h2>
			Keplerian Orbit Model</h2>
<p>
			We now introduce a model whose predictions are consistent with Kepler&#8217;s Laws.  This model is a submodel of the <i>Dynamics and Net Force</i> model.  It involves two bodies interacting only through gravity, where one of the bodies is so much more massive than the other that it can be <i>dynamically</i>&#160;(not gravitationally) approximated as an <a href="../../reference/Infinitely_massive_o.html">infinitely massive object</a>. </p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				The much more massive sun is fixed in position.</li>
<li>
				The much less massive planet moves under the sole influence of a gravitational attraction towards the sun that decreases as the inverse square of its distance from the sun</li>
<li>
				The planet moves according to Newton&#8217;s Laws of Motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This model applies to the solar system due to the extreme disparity between the mass of our Sun and the mass of the (several) planets. It can similarly be applied to satellite kinematics because of the relative isolation of the Earth and because it is so much more massive than any satellite. </p>
<p>  Due to Newton&#8217;s Laws and the central nature of the force, the motion of the planets is in a plane defined by the positions of the sun and planet and the initial velocity of the planet.  This model is a therefore special case of the Two-Dimensional Motion Model.</p>
<h3>
Learning Goals</h3>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				Describe the shape of a Keplerian Orbit.</li>
<li>
				Define apoapsis and periapsis.</li>
<li>
				Use Kepler's Third Law to relate the orbital period, the semi-major axis of the orbit, and the mass of the central object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Model: Keplerian Orbit</h2>
<h3>
Applicable Systems</h3>
<p>
			A single <a href="../../reference/Point_particle.html">point particle</a> and a single very massive object (approximated as&#160;<a href="../../reference/Infinitely_massive_o.html">infinitely massive object</a>. )</p>
<h3>
Relevant Interactions</h3>
<p>
			The point particle must experience only a <a href="../../reference/Universal_gravitatio.html">gravitational interaction</a> from the infinitely massive object (recall that although the mass is considered infinite for the purposes of the dynamics of that object, it is <em>not</em> assumed to be infinite when calculating its gravitational attraction).</p>
<h3>
Laws of Change</h3>
<p>
<i>NOTE: In this model, the mathematical form of the law of change is simplest when expressed in polar coordinates. The mathematical details of vector integration in polar coordinates are beyond the scope of this course, however, so we present only the key results derived by integrating the law of change. These are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kepler">Kepler's</a> First and Third Laws of planetary motion.</i></p>
<p>
			We label the gravitational mass of the very massive object&#160;<i>M</i> and locate it at the origin of the coordinate system (<i>r</i> = 0).</p>
<p>
<b>Kepler's First Law is Predicted:</b> The point particle moves in an elliptical path with the very massive object at one focus.</p>
<p>
<img width="500px" src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit12/Module1/files/OrbitEllipse.png"/></p>
<p>
			An illustration of a typical orbit is shown above. In this figure, <i>P</i> is the instantaneous position of the moving point particle. The infinitely massive object is located at <i>F</i><sub>1</sub>, one of the two foci of the ellipse, and this position is also the origin of the coordinate system. Note that the motion is two-dimensional in a plane defined by the velocity vector and the position vector of the point particle at any instant of the motion.</p>
<h4>
Corollary: Periapsis and Apoapsis</h4>
<div>
			Because of the asymmetric location of the infinitely massive object within the elliptical orbit, the two objects have a unique distance of closest approach and of farthest separation during each cycle of the motion. The distance of closest approach, denoted in the figure as <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>, is called the <b>periapsis</b>. The distance of maximum separation (<i>d</i><sub>2</sub>) is called the <b>apoapsis</b>. (You may have seen the terms apogee/perigee or aphelion/perihelion used to describe orbits. These term-pairs refer to the apoapsis/periapsis in the special cases of orbits around the Earth or the Sun, respectively.)</div>
<div>
			&#160;</div>
<div>
<b>Kepler's Third Law is Predicted:</b> The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.</div>
<p>
			This law was expanded into a predictive form by Newton when he formulated his law of gravitation:</p>
<p>
\(T^{2} = \frac{4\pi^{2}a^{3}}{GM}\)</p>
<p>
			where <i>T</i> is the orbital period, <i>a</i> is the semi-major axis of the orbit, <i>G</i> is Newton's gravitational constant and <i>M</i> is the gravitational mass of the very massive object.  (NOTE: The energy will also turn out to relate to the semi-major axis.) It is useful to remember that the full major axis distance (2<i>a</i>) of an orbit is equal to the sum of the apoapsis and periapsis. It is also important to note that the mass of the point particle does not affect its orbital period.</p>
