<h4>
			A Brief History of Planets</h4>
<p>
			Since before written history, humans have studied the heavens.  The celestial sphere of distant stars enchants both the mind and the soul (especially in the absence of artificial lighting).  But even more interesting is the movement of the sun, moon, and planets against this backdrop.  The sun&#8217;s movements herald the seasons and inspired the overall geometry of most pre-historic monuments.  Most puzzling was the motion of the planets: generally eastward with respect to the distant stars, but often the other way (retrograde motion towards the west).    Many imagined that these strange motions portended the future of mankind and of dramatic events on earth, adding to the mystery of planetary motion.  	Indeed, retrograde motion is generally considered a bad omen in astrology.			</p>
<p>
The history of science in general, and physics and astronomy in particular, encompasses centuries of improved understanding of these motions.  Major contributions were made by Copernicus&#8217; heliocentric model, Brae and his accurate measurements, and Kepler with his brilliant laws summarizing these measurements.  But the biggest triumph was Isaac Newton&#8217;s.</p>
<p>
The planets come far closer to a frictionless system than anything else in the solar system, and Kepler&#8217;s Laws encapsulated their observed behavior. Newton crowned his predecessors&#8217; achievements by deducing these laws from an inverse square law gravitation plus his own laws of motion.  His extensions of these laws to comets and unbound objects placed more jewels in his crown. </p>
<h4>
A Case Study in Applying Simultaneous Models</h4>
<p>
			While we conveniently divide Newtonian mechanics into our several core models, problems presented by nature may cut across these boundaries.   A classic problem of this type is the problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keplerian_orbit" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Keplerian orbit">Keplerian orbits</a>, also known as the&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Two-body problem">"two-body problem"</a>. &#160;&#160;In this unit we will show that this problem requires application of three of our five core models.  In dealing with its various aspects, we will need to introduce a new sub-model of <a href="../reference/Dynamics_and_Net_For.html">Dynamics and Net Force</a> and then apply this model &#160;simultaneously&#160;with the <a href="../reference/Constant_Mechanical_2.html">Constant Mechanical Energy</a> <i>and</i> the <a href="../reference/Constant_Angular_Mom.html">Constant Angular Momentum</a>.
