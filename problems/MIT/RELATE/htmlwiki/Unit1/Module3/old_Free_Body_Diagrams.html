<h3>
Free Body Diagrams and Double-Subscript Notation</h3>
<p>
			In solving mechanics problems, determining the net force on an object frequently allows us to write down a system of equations that describes the way motion changes. The strategy for identifying all the interactions and then identifying all the forces (and the direction of those forces) is to construct a "free body" diagram. A free body diagram considers the body to be free of the rest of the environment, with all interactions on the body replaced by the forces acting on it. There are often numerous interactions acting in various directions. Interactions fall into two general categories: contact or touching interaction and non-contact or "field" interactions (e.g. gravitation and magnetism). All of these interactions are represented as vectors drawn as arrows and labeled in such a way to indicate the two specific interacting bodies.</p>
<p>
			Since forces always arise between <b>pairs</b> of interacting objects (by Newton's Third Law), as soon as you identify one of these objects, you can begin to specify each distinct force acting on that body by identifying each interacting object. Consider first contact-interactions and then non-contact interaction sources such as the Earth. To label each interaction force consistently (there are two for each interaction!), several systems have evolved. In this text, forces will be labeled using a double subscript convention for the two interacting bodies, for example&#160;<b>F<sub>12</sub></b>. To keep track of which body corresponds to label "1" and "2" (and distinguish&#160;&#160;<b>F<sub>12&#160;</sub></b>from&#160;<b>F<sub>21</sub></b>), we adopt a specific <i>convention.&#160;</i>&#160;Learn this convention for this course, but be cautioned that other authors use a variety of conventions. The symmetry of Newton's Third Law is reflected in the notation, as we shall see.</p>
<p>
			In this convention, the first subscript denotes the object the force acts <i>on</i>, while the second subscript denotes the other object involved in that interaction. A shorthand for this notation is <b>F<sub>On By</sub></b> which represents the force <b>F</b>&#160;on the object (<strong>On</strong>)&#160;by the partner object (<strong>By)</strong> involved in the interaction. Often the type of interaction is indicated by another sub- or super-script, or by replacing the <b>F</b> by another symbol (e.g. <b>T</b> for tension).&#160;</p>

						One of the habits of the discipline of physics is adherence to strict rigor when defining terms and codifying both the ideas and the logic of the study. In order to avoid confusion and to help simplify communication, many mutually agreed upon symbols in physics are used. You are familiar with using single letters for some quantities. The English language bias is seen in many of these, e.g. "a" for acceleration, "m" for mass, "v" for velocity, "t" for time. This tradition creates problems, for example you might run out of variations for all of the physical quantities that start with the letter "t" that you want to label as "t": "t" is for time, "T" is for period of time to repeat the cycle, " \(\vec{T} \) " for tension force, or "&#964;" for torque. Using the same symbolic label for all of these would be impossible in an equation involving these parameters. Labeling forces precisely requires keeping track of five pieces of information.

							If you use <b>F<sub>AB</sub></b> for the force on A by B and I use <b>F<sub>BA</sub></b> for the SAME force on A by B, eventually we will get confused trying to communicate with each other. Worse, if you use <b>F<sub>AB</sub></b> for the force on A by B and later refer to the same force using the reversed notation <b>F<sub>BA</sub></b>, you will have introduced a significant logic error in your analysis. To avoid this dilemma we simply agree on a system and use it.</p>

										Caution: Many times too much information encoded in a label can be just as difficult as inconsistent notation. A good habit of mind when starting to model a problem with symbols is to review the symbolic language you have created after you think you have decoded the system thoroughly. If you can simplify the notation you use within a problem it will help you to recognize important relationships. If the symbolic language is too thick, it is easy to get lost in the notation and miss the physics. Strive to be concise and transparent in your notation.</td>
