Incorrect. Newton's 3rd Law says that the force acting on block 2 arising from block 1 must point in the direction opposite that of F<sub>12</sub>, which we drew to the left in the FBD for block 1. This should agree with your common sense: given our picture of the motion, it is clear that block 1 is pushing block 2 to the right.

Incorrect. What object could possibly be causing F<sub>2</sub> in this picture? Remember that forces are the agent of change for motion, they are not a result of motion. Just because block 2 is moving to the left does not mean it must have a force pointing to the left acting on it.
