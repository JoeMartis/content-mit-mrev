    <title>CheckPoint: Newton's 2nd Law 2</title>
    <h3>Check Your Understanding of Newton's Second Law</h3>
      <p>Suppose an object is initially sliding due east at constant speed on very slippery ground (obeying Newton's First Law) when it is suddenly acted on by a force that acts due north.  What is the direction of the object's acceleration?</p>
