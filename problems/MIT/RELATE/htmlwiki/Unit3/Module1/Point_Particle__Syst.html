<h2>
			Point Particles, System vs. Environment and Internal vs. External Forces</h2>
<p>
			It is possible to use Newton's Laws to study the motion of a collection of individual bodies all at once. The bodies whose motion is being simultaneously described is the "system" of interest. Any objects that interact with the system constitute the "environment".</p>
<h3>
Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
			After completing this module you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				Define the term <b>point particle</b> and explain when to apply the point particle approximation</li>
<li>
				Define the terms <b>system</b> and <b>environment</b></li>
<li>
				Define <b>internal</b> and <b>external</b> forces</li>
<li>
				Identify the <b>internal</b> and <b>external</b> interactions for a given situation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Point Particle Approximation</h3>
<p>
			The next unit is devoted to the description of <b>translational motion</b>, which begins with defining the position of an object measured relative to a point of reference. In the case of translational motion of a solid non-rotating object, all the points in the object are moving in the same way and any point in the object can be used to represent the position of that object. (This is not the case if the object is rotating). In other words, the dimensions and shape of the object are not relevant for describing its translational motion, and we can consider the object to be represented by a single point in space.</p>
<p>
			The point particle approximation is a good representation of a rigid object in which rotation is ignored. In this approximation the object's mass is considered to be localized at the object's center of mass (to be defined later), which is conventionally used as the "position" of an extended object.</p>
<h3>
System, System Constituents, and Environment, Internal and External Forces</h3>
<p>
			A <b>system</b> is the object or the group of objects whose motion we are describing. In a full treatment of mechanics, allowable massive objects include point particles, rigid bodies, elastic bodies, fluids, and gasses. In this course, we will consider only point particles and rigid bodies as possible <b>system constituents</b>. Systems can have massless objects in them also, like ideal ropes and springs.</p>
<p>
			Once the system is specified, all objects that are outside of its boundary are defined as the <b>environment</b>. Of course, objects in the environment can interact with the objects inside the system and affect their state of motion. The forces resulting from the interaction between the objects in the environment and those inside the system are called <b>external forces</b>.</p>
<p>
			Forces resulting from the interactions between two objects within the system are called <b>internal forces</b>. In the unit on momentum, you will learn that these affect neither the momentum of the system nor the motion of its center of mass.</p>
<p>
			Free Body Diagrams show the system isolated from its environment. <em>Only external forces are shown in the free body diagram</em>.</p>
