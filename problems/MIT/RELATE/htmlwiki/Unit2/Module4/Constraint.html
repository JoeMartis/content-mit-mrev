<h3>
Normal Force as a Constraint</h3>
<p>
			The normal force, like tension, arises from a dynamical constraint: it takes on whatever value is necessary to ensure that the objects in contact will not move into each other.</p>
<p>
			When objects come in contact, the contact interaction generates a normal force which causes the appropriate acceleration to change their velocities so they don't interpenetrate. &#160;In other words, the normal force&#160;<i>constrains</i>&#160;the motions of these objects so that they remain in contact without getting closer or farther from each other. This means they have the same velocity component in the normal (perpendicular to surface) direction.</p>
<p>
<em>Thus there is no "force law" for normal forces</em> &#8211; the normal force must be found using Newton's Second Law and determining the acceleration of the objects from their (constrained) motion.</p>

						An object in contact with a stationary horizontal surface like the floor is constrained to have no acceleration in the vertical direction (or it will break contact), but it may have a nonzero horizontal acceleration. Thus, the floor and the object need not have the same acceleration vector, but their acceleration vectors will have the same vertical component (zero in this case).

										An example is a box of mass <i> m </i> being pushed along a horizontal surface with a horizontal force of magnitude <i>F</i> as shown in the figure. The box interacts with three objects, the person pushing the box, the contact surface, and the Earth. As a result of these three interactions, there are three forces acting on the box as shown in the free body diagram:

<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
\(\vec{F}\) is the force exerted on the box by the person.</li>
<li>
\(\vec{F}_{bE}\) is the gravitational force on the box by the Earth. It has magnitude <i>mg</i> and points down</li>
<li>
\(\vec{N}_{bS}\) is the normal force exerted on the box by the surface. It points up, and its magnitude <i>N</i><sub><i>b</i><i>S</i></sub> must be determined from Newton's Laws and motion constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/>
											To obtain the normal force we need to consider the forces only along the vertical direction. We write the vertical component of Newton's Second Law consistent with the coordinate system indicated in the figure, +y axis upwards.</p>
<p>
											Newton's Second Law, \(\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}\), implies that along the y-axis</p>
<p>
<br/>
\( \mathcal{} N_{bS} - mg = ma_{y}\)</p>
<p>
<br/>
											Because there is no acceleration along the vertical direction, <i>a<sub>y</sub> = 0</i>, and we have</p>
<p>
<br/>
\(\mathcal{}N_{bS} = mg\)</p>
<p>
<br/>
											The value of the normal force is obtained as a consequence of Newton's Second Law and the constraint imposed by the contact between both rigid objects.</p>
