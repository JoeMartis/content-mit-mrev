<h2>
			Kinetic Friction Force.</h2>
<p>
			As discussed in the module about normal force, two objects in contact may slide parallel to their surface of contact with each other. This relative sliding motion will be subject to kinetic friction force that opposes the relative motion. This is the parallel component of the <a href="/courses/MITx/8.011x/Classical_Mechanics_Online/courseware/Unit_2_Interactions_and_Forces/Contact_Force_and_Applied_Force/">contact force</a>. Kinetic friction must be taken into account except that it can be ignored in low-friction surfaces such as very smooth surfaces and slippery surfaces such as ice, oiled smooth metal, etc. The qualifier <i>kinetic</i> refers to the sliding motion and is in contrast to static friction, which will be discussed in the next module.</p>
<h3>
Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
			After completing this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				Describe the conditions under which an object will be subject to a kinetic friction force.</li>
<li>
				Explain how to determine the direction of the kinetic friction force acting on an object.</li>
<li>
				Define the coefficient of kinetic friction and use it to relate the size of the kinetic friction force to the size of the associated normal force.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Properties of the Kinetic Friction Force</h3>
<p>
			When objects are in relative motion along a contact surface, the form of the kinetic friction force on the objects obeys two rules:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				The direction of the kinetic friction force on each object is such that it will oppose the relative motion of the objects along the surface.</li>
<li>
				The size of the kinetic friction force on each object is directly proportional to the size of the normal force between them. In other words, the harder the objects are pressed against each other, the greater the kinetic friction force that results.</li>
</ul>
<p>
			These rules should agree with your intuition, but it is worth remarking that one possible rule which might seem intuitively correct is <i>not</i> observed in nature: the friction force between two objects is generally <i>not</i> dependent on the area of contact between the objects.</p>
<h3>
Notation for Friction Forces</h3>
<p>
			In this course we denote friction forces with&#160;a lowercase&#160;<i>f</i> with two subscripts. The subscripts will still indicate the target ("on") and the source ("by") of the force, respectively. We will discuss the reason for this special notation when we introduce <a href="/courses/MITx/8.011x/Classical_Mechanics_Online/courseware/Unit_2_Interactions_and_Forces/Contact_Force_and_Applied_Force/">the full form of the contact force</a>.</p>
<h3>
The Coefficient of Kinetic Friction</h3>
<p>
			We can formally state the rule that the size of the kinetic friction force acting on object A as a result of its contact with object B is proportional to the normal force between A and B by writing the kinetic friction force law as:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}f^{k}_{AB} = \mu_{k} N_{AB}\)</p>
<p>
			In this equation, <i>f</i><sup>&#160;k</sup><sub>AB</sub> is the size of the kinetic friction force acting on object A as a result of its contact with object B, <i>N</i><sub><i>A</i><i>B</i></sub> is the size of the normal force acting on object A as a result of its contact with object B, and &#956;<sub><i>k</i></sub> is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the pair of surfaces in contact. The value of &#956;<sub><i>k</i></sub> will be different for different pairs of surfaces. A rubber shoe sole on concrete, for example, will have a much larger coefficient of kinetic friction than that same shoe sole would have on ice. The coefficient of friction is generally less than 1, though there are exceptions (see the entry for aluminum on aluminum in the table given in the following module for an example).</p>
