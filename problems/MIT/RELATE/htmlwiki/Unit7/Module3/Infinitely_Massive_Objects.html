<h3> Warning:  Watch Out for Infinitely Massive Objects</h3>
<p>In this module, we have emphasized the technique of choosing the system to include all objects involved in a collision, since this will allow us to assume that momentum is approximately conserved during the collision.  There is one important exception to this standard procedure, however.  The exception is well illustrated by the collision shown in the high-speed camera stills in this module: a tennis ball hitting a wooden platform.  The wooden platform in this case is sitting on the ground.  When the tennis ball hits it, we don't expect to observe any significant motion of the platform.  The reason is simple:  in order to move the platform, the ball would essentially have to move the entire earth! This does indeed happen.  Practically, however, the recoil of the earth from an impact with a tennis ball is so small that it is impossible to measure.  We would say that the earth effectively has <b>infinite mass</b> when compared to the tennis ball.  This is a big problem for momentum conservation.  If an infinitely massive object is included in the system, that object will <i>never</i> move, no matter what forces are applied to it.  It is easy to see that this ruins momentum conservation.  Consider the photos of the tennis ball's impact.  Clearly, the ball's momentum undergoes a major shift (from downward to upward).  If the earth does not move in response, then momentum conservation is destroyed.  (Of course, this problem is only due to the fact that we cannot accurately measure the recoil of the earth.  If we could precisely measure it, we would find that momentum <i>is</i> conserved.)  To avoid this trouble, we will insist that infinitely massive objects are <b>excluded</b> from systems when a Momentum Model is being used to describe their motion.  The influence of the earth <i>must</i> be treated as an external force on the ball.  The most commonly encountered infinitely massive objects are surfaces like walls, ramps and floors, but even a less sturdy "object" like a person can effectively have infinite mass if they are well braced against the earth.
