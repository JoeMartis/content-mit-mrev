<h3> Illustrative Example:  Return to the Pond</h3>
<p>The same family mentioned in the previous module is out on the frozen pond again.  This time, the pond is characterized by a coefficient of kinetic friction equal to 0.15.  Once again, the young girl and her brother are playing and manage to run into each other.  At the instant of the collision, the 20 kg girl is moving due east at 1.75 m/s and the 15 kg boy is moving due north at 1.75 m/s.  After the collision, the boy and girl become entangled and slide off as one "object".  The following parts refer to this situation.

<td> We want the impulse delivered to the boy during the collision.  As we stated in the S.I.M. above, we will make the usual assumption:  the impulse delivered by friction during the extremely brief collision is negligible, so essentially all the impulse comes from the contact force from the girl acting on the boy.  Unfortunately, we have no information about the size of this force.  Thus, the only way to find the impulse acting on the boy is to use the change in the boy's momentum.  We know that:
<p>\( \vec{J}_{bg} = \vec{p}_{b,f} - \vec{p}_{b,i}\)
</p><p>where <i>J<sub>bg</sub></i> is the impulse from the girl on the boy.  There is a problem here, however.  We know the boy's initial momentum, but we do not know his final momentum.  We will have to solve for it.

<tr style="display:none" id="ht5">
<td> Since we have deduced that we will need the boy's velocity, we have to find a way to solve for it.  The boy's final velocity can be found by using the fact that the momentum of the boy plus the girl treated as a single system is conserved during the collision.  For this composite system, the collision forces are internal and so they do not contribute to the net <i>external</i> impulse.  Since we are neglecting the small external impulse contributed by friction, momentum is conserved.  We can therefore solve using exactly the same procedure as we did in Part B of the example in the previous module, finding the same answer for the final velocity of the system:
<p>\(\vec{v}_{f} = \mbox{1.25 m/s at 37}^{\circ}\mbox{ N of E}\)
</p><p>Since the entire system has this velocity immediately after the collision, and the boy is part of the system, this is his velocity after the collision.

 [<a href="javascript:toggleDisplay('ht6','hide','show')" id="ht6l">show</a>]</th></tr>
<tr style="display:none" id="ht6">
<td> We now have to shift our focus.  In the previous part of the problem, we treated the boy plus the girl as a single system.  This allowed us to conserve momentum and learn about the velocity immediately after the collision.  Now, we want to find the impulse on the boy.  This requires us to find the change in his momentum during the collision.  We can only find that by considering the boy as an independent system.  If we look at the collision from this point of view, we can see that the boy's momentum has certainly changed.  As usual, we compute the change in components:
<p>\(\mathcal{}J_{bg,x}= p_{b,f,x} - p_{b,i,x} = m_{b}v_{f,x} - m_{b}v_{b,i,x} \)
</p><p>and
</p><p>\(\mathcal{}J_{bg,y} = p_{b,f,y} - p_{b,i,y} = m_{b}v_{f,y} - m_{b}v_{b,i,y} \)
</p><p>The boy's final velocity was found above, and so we can substitute to find:
</p><p>\(\mathcal{}J_{bg,x} = (\mbox{15 kg})(\mbox{1.0 m/s}) - (\mbox{15 kg})(\mbox{0 m/s}) = \mbox{15 kg m/s}\)
</p><p>and
</p><p>\(\mathcal{}J_{bg,y} = (\mbox{15 kg})(\mbox{0.75 m/s}) - (\mbox{15 kg})(\mbox{1.75 m/s}) = - \mbox{15 kg m/s}\)
</p><p>Thus, the vector triangle for the impulse delivered to the boy looks like:
</p><p><img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit7/Module3/files/BoyImpulseVec.png"/>
</p><p>and the Pythagorean theorem plus trigonometry tells us that the total impulse delivered to him in the collision is:
</p><p>\( \vec{J}_{bg} = \mbox{21 kg m/s at 45}^{\circ}\mbox{ S of E}\)

</p><p>Note:  The change in the girl's momentum during the collision would be the same size as the boy's but directed in exactly the opposite direction (45&#176; N of W).  Can you explain why?  Consider how we solved for the boy's final velocity.

<td> In this problem, we will be applying two separate Models at different times:  Constant Momentum first, then Motion with Constant Acceleration.  Because the Models are not applied simultaneously, we have the freedom to redefine the coordinates when we switch to the Constant Acceleration Model.  In this case, we can help ourselves out by defining a new x-axis that points in the same direction as the post-collision velocity of the boy and girl, since we must recognize the constraint that the post-collision velocity will be the initial velocity of the subsequent motion.  We will keep the origin of the coordinates right at the collision point, since then the initial position for the subsequent motion will be zero.  With these choices, the motion of the boy and girl after the collision will occur entirely along the x-axis since friction will just work to slow down the speed of the boy and girl (it will not cause them to turn at all).
