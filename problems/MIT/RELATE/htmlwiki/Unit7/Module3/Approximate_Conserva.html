<h2>Approximate Conservation of Momentum in Collisions</h2>
<p>During the extremely brief interval of a collision (or an explosion), the contact interaction between the colliding objects tends to dominate all other forces acting on those objects, causing dramatic changes in velocity and momentum of these objects in a very short time.  In consequence, if the objects participating in the collision are used to define a system, collision forces become internal forces, and the much smaller external forces acting on the system give negligible impulse to that system on the short timescale of the collision.  This means that the system's momentum will remain approximately constant during the collision.
</p>
<h3> Learning Goals</h3>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none"><li> Give an approximate definition of a collision.
</li><li> Explain the conditions on the system for approximate conservation of momentum during a collision.
</li><li> Define "infinitely massive object" and explain why the Constant Momentum Model cannot apply to a system including one.
</li></ul>
<h3> Collisions</h3>
<p>Interesting multi-body systems frequently include collisions between the constituents.  It is hard to give a precise definition of what constitutes a "collision", but for the purposes of this module, we will consider a collision to be a physical contact between two fairly rigid objects that are moving with different velocities.  The rigidity of the objects is important, because it leads to a large collision force during a collision that is very short.  By "very short", we generally mean a few <i>milliseconds</i> in duration.  The high-speed photographs shown in the next module illustrate the collision of a standard tennis ball dropped from a height of 100 inches onto a wooden platform.  Based upon the fact that the images are spaced by about 1 millisecond (0.001 s) in time, you can see that the entire duration of the tennis ball's contact with the platform is about 5 or so milliseconds.  Thus, a tennis ball counts as a fairly rigid object, even though it deforms considerably upon impact.  (One example of an object that isn't very rigid is a human being.  We can purposely deform our bodies during a low-speed impact like a jump from a low platform to maximize the "collision" time and minimize the contact forces.)
