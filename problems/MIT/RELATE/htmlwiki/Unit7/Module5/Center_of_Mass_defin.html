<h2>Center of Mass.</h2>
The center of mass of a system is a useful way to describe the average position of the system.
<h4> Learning Goals</h4>
<p>After you finish this module you should be able to:
</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none"><li> Calculate the center of mass of a system of several point particles.
</li><li> Explain how to calculate the center of mass of a rigid object.
</li><li> Calculate the center of mass of a system of several extended object.
</li></ul>
<h3> Center of Mass: Introduction</h3>
<p>When describing the translational motion of an extended object or system of objects, we can represent the object as a point particle, as if all its mass were concentrated at one point. This point, located at the average location of the distributed mass, is called the center of mass. For example, a uniform rod has its center of mass right at its middle. In this module we will learn how to calculate the center of mass of an object or a group of objects.
</p><p>Moreover, we will show that the overall translational motion of a system can be described in terms of the <b>center of mass of the system</b>. The system under consideration can be a group of particles, such as the molecules of a gas in a container, or a group of extended objects such as the boy and the girl playing on the icy lake from the previous unit.
</p><p>The athlete shown in the movie is an example of a non-rigid extended object. The motion of all the different parts of his body can be complicated, but the motion of the athlete's center of mass (red solid path) is the same as the motion of a point particle with a mass equal to the athlete's mass. The two dash lines represent the paths of other parts of the extended object (the head and right foot). While the athlete is in the air, the external force acting on the athlete is gravity. As a result, his center of mass follows the parabola familiar from projectile motion.

</p><p>We will see that the location of the center of mass can be either fixed relative to an object, as in the example of the athlete, or it can be a point in space (e.g. a discrete distribution of masses as in examples 1 and 2 below).
</p>
<h3> The center of mass of a system of 2 point particles </h3>
<p>Consider a system formed by two point particles of masses <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> located at positions 
\(\vec{r}_1\) and \(\vec{r}_2\) measured with respect to point <i>Q</i> as shown in the figure below. The position of the center of mass with respect to the coordinate system with origin at point <i>Q</i> is obtained as:
</p><p><img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit7/Module5/files/Cm2Particlesc_small.png"/>
</p><p><br/>
The center of mass, <i>cm</i> in the figure, represents the mean location of the mass of the system.  It is located along a line between the particles and closer to the more massive particle. In the example below <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> &gt; <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>.
