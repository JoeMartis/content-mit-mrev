        <p><b> Answer:</b>The correct answer is that the right piece will have more mass. To see why, replace the right piece by a point particle of mass <i>m<sub>R</sub></i> and the left piece by a point particle of mass <i>m<sub>L</sub></i>. Place each of the masses in their center of mass. Measured with respect to the baseball center of mass, the center of mass of the right mass is at a distance <i>d<sub>R</sub></i> and the one of the left mass is at a distance <i>d<sub>L</sub></i>. Because of the way the mass is distributed throughout the right and left pieces we can say that <i>d<sub>R</sub></i> &lt; <i>d<sub>L</sub></i>. Then the center of mass is closer to the right piece. The right mass is the largest.</p>
