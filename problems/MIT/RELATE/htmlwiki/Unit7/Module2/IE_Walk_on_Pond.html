<h3> Illustrative Example:  A Walk on the Pond</h3>
<p>A family which includes a girl with a mass of 20 kg and her younger brother who has a mass of 15 kg is out playing on a pond covered with frictionless ice.  The following problems refer to this situation.

<table class="wikitable collapsible collapsed">

<th> <b>Part A:</b>  The girl and her brother are standing next to each other at rest, when suddenly the boy reaches out and gives his sister a big shove.  As a result of the push, the girl ends up moving off at a speed of 3.0 m/s.  What is the boy's resulting motion?

<td> We will choose the x-axis to point along the direction of the girl's motion (the exact origin does not matter for momentum, since it only involves velocity and not position).  The resulting initial state-final state diagram is:
<p><img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit7/Module2/files/BoyGirlPush.png"/>
</p><p>Note that the initial state is very simple.  Neither the boy nor the girl is moving, so the total momentum is clearly zero.  
</p><p>The final state, however, is more complicated.  We have assumed that the boy will move <i>backward</i> after pushing his sister.  You can arrive at this conclusion using what we have learned in Units 1 and 2 of this course, or even what we have learned so far in a previous unit:
</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none"><li> <b>Explanation 1</b> (Newton's Third Law):  When the boy pushes the girl, Newton's Third Law guarantees that the boy experiences an equal and <i>opposite</i> force.  Since the force on the boy is directly opposite to the force on the girl, the boy's motion will be in the opposite direction.
</li><li> <b>Explanation 2</b> (Looking Ahead):  Another way to understand the boy's motion is to look ahead.  We are going to use the fact that momentum is conserved to solve this problem, so the total momentum should remain equal to the initial value, which we know to be zero!  Since the girl clearly has a nonzero momentum, this would seem to be a problem, unless we remember that momentum is a vector.  Thus, by moving off in the opposite direction, which is <i>negative</i> in our coordinate system, the boy's momentum can cancel the girl's giving zero.

<p>\(\mathcal{}m_{b}v_{b,i,x} + m_{g}v_{g,i,x} = m_{b}v_{b,f,x} + m_{g}v_{g,f,x}\)

</p><p>Note that the x-component of the boy's final velocity is found to be in the opposite direction from the girl's (as shown by the negative sign) confirming the assumption we made in our initial state-final state diagram.  If we had guessed wrong in the picture, the math would still tell us the correct direction for the velocity.  
</p><p>Substituting numbers gives the final result:
</p><p>\( v_{b,f,x} = -\frac{(\mbox{20 kg})(\mbox{3.0 m/s})}{\mbox{15 kg}} = - \mbox{4 m/s}\)

<th> <b>Part B:</b> Now suppose the boy is moving due north at 1.75 m/s and his sister is moving due east at 1.75 m/s.  They are headed for a collision.  When they collide, they become entangled and slide off as one "object".  What is their velocity after the collision?

<td> This problem is inherently two-dimensional, since the boy and girl are moving at a right angle to each other.  We will choose the x-axis to point due east (the direction of the girl's motion) and the y-axis to point due north (the direction of the boy's motion).  For simplicity, we will put the origin of the coordinates at the location of the collision.  The resulting initial state-final state diagram is:
<p><img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit7/Module2/files/BoyGirlCollide.png"/>
</p><p>Once again, we have had to assume the direction of the final momentum.  Just as we did in Part A, we have used the fact that momentum is conserved in making our assumption.  Since the system composed of the boy and girl has positive x-momentum in the initial state (from the girl's motion) and also positive y-momentum (from the boy) we expect (since we are using the Constant Momentum Model) that the final system momentum will point into the first quadrant (positive x and y components).

<td> The mathematical representation of momentum conservation for this system consists of <i>two</i> equations, one for the x and one for the y direction:

</p><p>and
</p><p>\(\mathcal{}m_{b}v_{b,i,y} + m_{g}v_{g,i,y} = (m_{b} + m_{g})v_{f,y}\)
</p><p>Note that we have defined only one final velocity, which applies to <i>both</i> the boy and the girl.  The reason is that we know the boy and girl are stuck together after the collision, and so they must have the same velocity.  This was shown in our initial state-final state diagram above.
</p><p>Substituting zeros, we find:
</p><p>\( \mathcal{}m_ {g}v_{g,i} = (m_{b} + m_{g})v_{f,x}\)
</p><p>and
</p><p>\( \mathcal{}m_ {b}v_{b,i} = (m_{b} + m_{g})v_{f,y}\)

</p><p>To find the total velocity, we must construct a vector triangle using these components:
</p><p><img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit7/Module2/files/BoyGirlFinalV.png"/>
</p><p>the Pythagorean theorem then gives a magnitude:
</p><p>\( v_{f} = \sqrt{(\mbox{1.0 m/s})^{2} + (\mbox{0.75 m/s})^{2}} = \mbox{1.25 m/s}\)
</p><p>To find the direction, we select an angle to find using trigonometry.  We will use the typical angle, measured from the positive x-axis, as shown in the figure below.
</p><p><img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit7/Module2/files/BoyGirlVAngle.png"/>
</p><p>This angle is:
</p><p>\( \theta = \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{\mbox{0.75 m/s}}{\mbox{1.0 m/s}}\right) = 37^{\circ}\)
</p><p>Since the initial velocities were given in terms of the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) it is reasonable to report this answer as:
</p><p>\( \vec{v}_{f} = \mbox{1.25 m/s at 37}^{\circ}\mbox{ N of E}\)
</p><p>where "N of E" means that the angle is measured moving toward the north from due east.
