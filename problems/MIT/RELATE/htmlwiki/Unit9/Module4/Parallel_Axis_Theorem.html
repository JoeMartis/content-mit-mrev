			The Parallel Axis Theorem</h3>
		<p>
			Up until now, we have computed moments of inertia in cases where the axis of rotation passes through the center of mass of the rigid body.
			 What if the body is constrained to rotate about a different axis? In this course we will only consider one generalization, 
			 the case where the axis is shifted over but remains parallel to the center-of-mass axis. In this case, we can use a result known as 
			 the parallel axis theorem to find the moment of inertia.</p>
		<p>
			Consider an object of mass M with moment of inertia about an axis passing through its center of mass, <i>I<sub>cm</sub></i>. The moment 
			of inertia about an axis parallel to the one passing through the center of mass is given by:</p>
		<p>
			\(\displaystyle I_{axis}=I_{CM}+Md^2 \)</p>
		<p>
			where <i>d</i> is the perpendicular distance between the two axis as shown in the following video.<br />
