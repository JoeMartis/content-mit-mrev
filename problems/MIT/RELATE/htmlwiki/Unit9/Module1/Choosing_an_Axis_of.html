<h2>
			Fixed Axis Rotation and Describing Rotational Motion</h2>
<p>
			The rotation of a rigid object may occur in combination with translational motion. For this module, we will concentrate on the description of rotational motion about a <i>fixed axis, </i>i.e. in the absence of translational motion.</p>
<h3>
Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
			After working through this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				Describe the rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis.</li>
<li>
				Define the angular velocity in terms of the rate of change of the angular position.</li>
<li>
				Indicate the direction of rotation of a rigid object and apply the right hand rule.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
			Restrictions on Rotational Motion for this Course</h3>
<p>
			In this module we will concentrate on <i>fixed axis rotation</i>, the rotation of a rigid body around an axis that is fixed to the body as well as fixed in space. Later we will describe motion involving translation and rotation combined, but with the restriction to axes passing through the center of mass and oriented parallel to an axis of symmetry of the body.</p>
<p>
			These restrictions are important because the rotation of an asymmetrical rigid body can be very complex. For example, its axis of rotation can not only change orientation with respect to the body but can also change direction in space &#8211; even in the absence of any torques acting on the body! (Such motion is out of the scope of any introductory physics class.)</p>
<p>
			Thus we will make the following restrictions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>
				The rigid body rotates about a fixed axis of rotation.</li>
<li>
				We will consider objects that are thin, for example the disk in figure a) or the rod in figure b).</li>
<li>
				The rotation is in the plane where the object is contained, e.g. the xy plane in the figure below.</li>
<li>
				The axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane where the object is contained, the z-axis in the figures below.</li>
</ol>
<p>
			Under these conditions, the objects will rotate in the x-y plane while lying flat at z = 0.</p>

<h3>
A Rigid Body Constrained to Rotate About a Fixed Axis</h3>
<p>
			The simplest case of rotational motion is a rigid body like the disk or the bar shown above that can rotate about an axle or hinge that
			 is fixed in space (and also fixed to the body). The axle or hinge does not translate, but allows rotation. This case illustrates clearly
			  the notion of an axis of rotation.</p>
			  
<p> Imagine a point that lies at the center of the disk, point <b>Q</b>, in the figure below. As the body
	rotates about the axle, this point does not move at all. Any other point like point <b>B</b> will move in a circular path as the rotation
 occurs.</p>
<p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit9/Module1/files/Torque_RotatingDiskTwoAxis.png"/></p>
<p>
			Now imagine that the axle passes through point <b>B</b>, perpendicular to the plane of the disk, the xy plane, in the right figure above. 
			This new axle does not translate while the body rotates, so point <b>B</b> won&#8217;t move in this case. Any other point in the 
			object, like the point <b>Q</b>, will move. </p>
<p>
			In summary, when we talk about a fixed axis of rotation we need to imagine a line perpendicular to the plane where the rigid body is rotating.
		 In general we will consider the object contained and rotating within the xy plane, therefore the axis of rotation will be parallel to the z-axis. 
		 The point of intersection between this line and the plane, the point <b>Q</b> in the left figure above, will also be fixed in space.</p>
