<h2>
			Defining Torque</h2>
<h3>
Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
			After working through this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				Represent the torque about a point in terms of the cross product of the position vector and the force</li>
<li>
				Calculate the magnitude of the torque about a point in terms of the perpendicular component of the force and of the moment arm</li>
<li>
				Determine the direction of the torque.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Motivation of the Concept </h3>
<p>
			In our study of translational motion under force, the location where the force was applied to the system did not matter. The subsequent translational motion only depended on the magnitude and direction of the net force. We will see that this simplification no longer holds for rotational motion. Forces applied to a body in an attempt to produce rotation will have <em>different effects depending on the location of application and the direction of the applied force</em>.&#160;</p>
<p>
			Consider trying to close a door by applying a force to the door near the hinges or in the middle of the door. Getting the door to close is much easier when the force is applied far from the hinges (see force <b>F<sub>3</sub></b> in the figure below). This is why we usually place door handles by the edge opposite the hinges.</p>
<p>
			A well chosen location is not enough to guarantee effective rotation from an applied force. Consider another experiment. Suppose that you stand at the edge of an open door and push the door edge toward the hinges (see the force <b>F<sub>1</sub></b> in the figure below). The door will not rotate, even with a hard push. This indicates that the direction of the force also affects the rotation produced.</p>
<p>

<p>
			With these experiments in mind, we recognize that we must define a new quantity that relates the force applied to the resulting rotation about a specific axis (in our examples, the axis was set by the line of the door hinges). This quantity, a vector called <b>torque</b>, will depend on the location where the force is applied (with respect to the axis of rotation) as well as on the direction of the applied force.</p>
<h3>
Definition of Torque </h3>
<p>
			Consider a force \(\vec{F}\) that is applied at a given point <b>A</b> as shown in the figure below. The torque about point <i><b>Q</b></i> is defined by the <b> vector product </b> (see below):</p>
<p>
\(\vec{\tau}_{\tiny Q} = \vec{r}\times \vec{F}\)</p>
<p>
			where the vector \(\vec{r}\) is the position vector of the point <b>A</b> measured from point <i><b>Q</b></i>.</p>
<p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/analiab/Figures/torque_definitiond.png"/></p>
<br/>
<p>
			Computing the torque resulting from a force requires three pieces of information:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>
				The point about which the force produces the torque (so far we have used the location of the axis of rotation).</li>
<li>
				The force applied (magnitude and direction).</li>
<li>
				The position (magnitude and direction) of the point at which the force is applied.</li>
</ol>
<p>
			It is imperative to realize that we must have a point of reference to measure the position of the point at which the force is applied. We refer to that point as point <i><b>Q</b></i> and the torque calculated with respect to the axis that passes through point <i><b>Q</b></i> as \(\vec{\tau}_{\tiny Q}\).</p>
<p>
			The torque is most succinctly defined by using the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vvec.html"> vector product operation</a> (also called the cross product) between the position vector and the force vector. Observe that the vector product of two vectors is another vector. We will discuss the direction of torque vector in the following section.</p>
<h4>
Dimensions and Units</h4>
<p>
			The dimensions of the torque are \(m l^2 t^{-2}\) (dimensions of force times length, or also energy). The SI units are <b>N m</b> (or Joules). It may seem strange to measure torque in units of energy, but it is consistent with the idea that a torque times an angle (which is dimensionless) does work, just like a force times a distance is work. (And work is energy, as you know.)</p>
<p>
			Remark: in most of the examples in introductory physics, the forces producing rotation of a rigid body are contained in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. In the example above, the door rotates about the z-axis and the force <b>F<sub>3</sub></b> lies in the xy - plane. Below are typical examples of fixed-axis rotation found in problems.</p>
