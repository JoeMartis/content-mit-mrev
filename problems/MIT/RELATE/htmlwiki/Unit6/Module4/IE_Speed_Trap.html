										The police car's motion is approximated by the "One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration" Model, which means we have several equations to choose from when describing the police car's motion. As we will see when we attempt to apply the constraints in this problem, however, it is important to find the police car's position as a function of time. The appropriate function is:
										<p>
\(\mathcal{}x_{p}(t) = x_{p,i} + v_{p,i}(t-t_{i}) + \frac{1}{2}a_{p}(t-t_{i})^{2}\)</p>
<p>

<p>
											We now apply our <b>first constraint</b>: the time coordinate must match for each system. Thus, if we choose t<sub>i</sub> = 0 for the speeder, we <b>must</b> also choose t<sub>i</sub> = 0 for the police car. Thus, based upon our choices for the speeder, we must write the position of the police car in the form:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}x_{p}(t) = x_{p,i} + v_{p,i}t + \frac{1}{2}a_{p}t^{2} \)</p>
<p>
											We also know that the police car has zero speed and zero position (according to our choice of coordinate system) at the time t = 0. Thus, we have:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}x_{p}(t) = \frac{1}{2}a_{p}t^{2} \)</p>

<tr style="display:none" id="ht5">
<td>
										Having established equations that give the position of each car as a function of time, we now wish to find the time when the police car catches the speeder. To determine this time mathematically, we apply the <b>constraint</b> that the position of <i>both</i> cars must be equal at the time the police car catches the speeder (this is the definition of "catching"). To realize this constraint, we define a time t<sub>catch</sub> and a position x<sub>catch</sub>. This mathematical constraint (like many aspects of motion) is best represented pictorially, as in the figure below.
										<p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit6/Module4/files/Speedtrap1b.png"/></p>
<p>
											To realize the constraint in our equations, we make use of the position functions we established above. Both the speeder and the police car reach position x<sub>catch</sub> at time t<sub>catch</sub> meaning:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}x_{catch} = v_{s}t_{catch}\)</p>
<p>
<i>and</i></p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}x_{catch} = \frac{1}{2}a_{p}t_{catch}^{2}\)</p>
<p>
											Setting these two different expressions for x<sub>catch</sub> equal to each other will allow us to find t<sub>catch</sub></p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}v_{s}t_{catch} = \frac{1}{2}a_{p}t_{catch}^{2}\)</p>
<p>
											This is a quadratic equation in t<sub>catch</sub> with the constant term equal to zero. Thus, we can solve by first rearranging into the standard form for a quadratic equation</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{} \frac{1}{2}a_{p}t_{catch}^{2} - v_{s}t_{catch} = 0\)</p>
<p>
											and then factoring:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{} \left(\frac{1}{2}a_{p}t_{catch} - v_{s}\right)t_{catch} = 0\)</p>
<p>
											which yields the two roots:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{} t_{catch} = 0 \)</p>
<p>
											or</p>
<p>
\( \mathcal{}t_{catch} = \frac{2v_{s}}{a_{p}}\)</p>
<p>
											The root t = 0 is not the one we are looking for, but it does make sense that this root emerged as a possible solution. We have been trying to construct an equation that tells us when the police car and the speeder share the same position. Clearly, they <i>do</i> share the same position at t = 0, since that was when the speeder initially passed the stationary police car. This is not the root we seek, however, since we want to find the time after the initial pass that the police car again comes even with the speeder. Thus, we select the second root</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{} t_{catch} = \frac{2v_{s}}{a_{p}} = 9.8 \mbox{ s}\)</p>

										Although we have already solved the problem, it is useful to revisit the solution and demonstrate a powerful graphical technique that will help you remember the mathematical form of the solution. Suppose we graphed the equations we found for the position of the speeder and the position of the police car as functions of time. The speeder's position versus time graph is linear, while the police car's is parabolic.

<td>
										Having worked Version 1 of this problem, we know that the coordinate system and the associated constraints on the locations of the police car and the speeder is the key idea in this problem. Thus, we must define a single coordinate system that will be used to describe the motion of <i>both</i> systems. We again choose the positive x-axis to point in the direction of the speeder's motion and to select <i>x</i> = 0, but in this problem it is '<i>not</i> a good plan to choose <i>t</i> = 0 at the instant the speeder and police car pass for the first time. The reason is subtle: we are describing the police car with the "Constant Acceleration" Model, but the police car does not actually begin accelerating until the speeder has gone past. Thus, we <i>cannot</i> begin applying the "Constant Acceleration" Model until the speeder is 100 m past the police car. It will therefore be advantageous to set <i>t</i> = 0 at the instant the speeder is 100 m past the police car. This choice is also convenient from the perspective of the problem statement, which asks us for the elapsed time from the moment the police car begins its acceleration. A pictorial representation of these choices is:

<tr style="display:none" id="ht11">
<td>
										As discussed in Version 1 of the problem, one mathematical approach to solving is to plot our functions describing the position of the speeder and police car on the same axes and look for intersections. The resulting plot is shown below. Note that this time the speeder's graph does not begin at <i>x</i> = 0, thus there is no second intersection at <i>positive</i> times. If you were to extend each graph to negative times, there would be a second intersection. (<b>Challenge:</b> does this second potential intersection have a physical meaning, like the intersection at <i>t</i> = 0 did in Version 1?)
										<p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit6/Module4/files/Speedtrap2both.gif"/></p>
<p>
											We can also solve the problem purely using equations if we simply set the position of the speeder equal to the position of the police car. This results in the quadratic equation for t<sub>catch</sub>:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{} x_{s,i} + v_{s}t_{catch} = \frac{1}{2}a_{p}t_{catch}^{2}\)</p>
<p>
											which we can put into canonical form:</p>
<p>
\( \mathcal{}\frac{1}{2}a_{p} t_{catch}^{2} - v_{s}t_{catch} - x_{s,i} = 0\)</p>
<p>
											This time, we cannot solve for the roots by simply factoring out a <i>t</i>, because of the constant term provided by the nonzero initial position of the speeder. Instead, we apply the quadratic equation:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}t_{catch} = \frac{ v_{s} \pm \sqrt{v_{s}^{2} + 2 a_{p} x_{s,i}}}{a_{p}}\)</p>
<p>
											which evaluates to:</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}t_{catch} = -\mbox{3.1 s}\)</p>
<p>
											or</p>
<p>
\(\mathcal{}t_{catch} = \mbox{12.9 s}\)</p>
<p>
											We must choose the positive root, since the Models we have chosen are <i>not valid descriptions of the motion</i> before <i>t</i> = 0 in our coordinates. Thus, the police car will catch the speeder 12.9 seconds after the police car begins accelerating. This solution is consistent with the point of intersection in the graph above.</p>
