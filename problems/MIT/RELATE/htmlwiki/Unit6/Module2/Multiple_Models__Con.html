<h2>
Utility of Multiple Simultaneous Models</h2>
<p>
			Describing the motion of a single system sometimes necessitates the <i>simultaneous</i> application of multiple models. An example of this is the motion of an object released into freefall with a nonzero horizontal component to its initial velocity. Such an object is called a <i>projectile</i> and its motion is called <i>projectile motion</i>.</p>
<h3>
Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
			After working through this module you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				Explain the significance of initial conditions in distinguishing between freefall and projectile motion.</li>
<li>
				Explain why two Models in the hierarchy are needed to describe projectile motion.</li>
<li>
				Use time as a constraint to couple the equations governing the horizontal and vertical motion of a projectile.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
			Projectile Motion</h3>
<p>
			Like any object in freefall near the Earth, projectiles experience the constant acceleration of gravity, 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> directed downward (assuming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Drag (physics)">air resistance</a> is negligible). Unlike the motion of an object thrown directly upward or directly downward, however, projectile motion is inherently two-dimensional. Projectiles <i>do not</i> follow a straight line as they move. Instead, as illustrated in the applet below, projectiles trace out a segment of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parabola" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:parabola">parabola</a> as they move. Thus, it might seem that we need a new model (something like "two-dimensional motion with constant acceleration") to represent the motion of a projectile. By decomposing vectors into components, however, we can actually employ the models we have already developed to describe projectile motion.</p>
<p>
			Note that gravitational acceleration is purely vertical. The x-component of the projectile's motion experiences <i>no acceleration</i> while the y-component experiences freefall. Thus, the two-dimensional motion of a projectile can be described by saying that the projectile is governed <i>simultaneously</i> by <i>two one-dimensional</i> models: the x-component motion is governed by the Constant Velocity (Zero Acceleration) model and the y-component motion is governed by the One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration model.</p>
<h3>
Constraints on Multiple Models</h3>
<p>
			When multiple models apply to a single system, it is vitally important to recognize what physical variables appear in <i>both</i> of the models. These quantities will serve to constrain the equations and allow us to solve them. In projectile motion, the quantity that serves to tie the x and y directions together is time. Unless you really enjoy nasty algebra, it is <b>strongly</b> recommended that you set up your equations such that the time coordinate is the same in the x-motion and the y-motion. The advantage of making this choice is clear: if you can find the time associated with an important event by looking at the y-motion (for example the time to reach maximum height or the time to hit the ground) you can use that value to determine the x-coordinate at the same instant, or vice versa.</p>
