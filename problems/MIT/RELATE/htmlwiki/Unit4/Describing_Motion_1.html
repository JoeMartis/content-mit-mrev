<h2>
			Describing Motion: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration</h2>
<p>
			In the previous units on Newton's Laws, we presented our first description of the effects of interactions on motion. Newton's Second Law describes how net force changes velocity. This is one of the key core physical models, the one from which we derive the others. This course is concerned with several such descriptions, which we will call Core Models.</p>
<p>
			The core models are very general, and it is often useful to think through the consequences of these in more detail, and to collect together the related phenomena in models that show their relationships. The first such Model we present is a description of the motion of a single point particle through the specification of its position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time, given that it is subject to a time-varying force. The key point is that what we see and measure is the position at a particular time; the velocity is computed (perhaps in the brain), and the change in velocity is less perceptible (even though that is what the forces control). Thus to relate what we see to the underlying causative forces it is helpful to already have in mind how these three quantities interrelate. This Model is given the name "Dynamics and Net Force".</p>
<h3>
Models are Arranged in a Hierarchy</h3>
<p>
			In this unit we also introduce the idea of a hierarchy of Models in physics, each a useful special case of a more general model. We apply this approach to the motion of a point particle by considering the Dynamics and Net Force Model in certain special cases. For instance, it is often useful to assume an object is experiencing constant acceleration (due to constant net force like gravity). Therefore, it is also useful to be familiar with the consequences of this assumption. In one sense, Motion with Constant Acceleration is a Model just as Dynamics and Net Force is a Model, but in another sense, Dynamics and Net Force is more general -- it includes Motion with Constant Acceleration as a special case. For this reason, in this course we present a "Hierarchy of Models for Mechanics" that emphasizes which commonly encountered Models are special cases of other Models.</p>
