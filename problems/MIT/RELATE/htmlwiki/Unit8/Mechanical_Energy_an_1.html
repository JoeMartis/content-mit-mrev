Total Energy</h2>
<h3>
			Learning Goals</h3>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				To identify different forms of energy: mechanical, thermal, chemical, etc.</li>
<li>
				To explain the difference between Mechanical Energy and the Total Energy.</li>
<li>
				To define the types of energy contributing to the Mechanical Energy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Various Types of Energy Depend on Related State Variables</h3>
<p>
			The energy of a system is a function of its current condition only (i.e. the values of its various "state variables": physical quantities that describe the state of a system at a specific moment in time. Examples are: velocity, position and temperature). It does not depend on the prior history of the system.</p>
<p>
			In Mechanics, we will be concerned exclusively with Mechanical Energy. In fact, we will often use just &#8220;energy&#8221; to refer to Mechanical Energy.</p>
<p>
			Given the state variables of a system, one can compute the various contributions to mechanical energy, which are listed to the right of the arrows:</p>
<table class="wikitable">

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Angular Velocity</b>&#8594;<b>Rotational Kinetic Energy</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
			The following state variables determine forms of energy that contribute to Total Energy but <i>do not contribute</i> to the Mechanical Energy:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
<li>
				temperature&#8594;internal energy</li>
<li>
				amount of various chemicals&#8594; chemical energy</li>
<li>
				amount of various nuclear isotopes&#8594; nuclear energy</li>
</ul>
<p>
			The <b>systems</b> we consider in this text consist of mechanical bodies, each of which has kinetic energy due to both translation (of its center of mass) and rotation (about its center of mass). The potential energy of a system will be due to gravity and elastic deformation (as in springs or flexible levers).</p>
<h3>
Total Energy of a system</h3>
<p>
			The total energy of a system is the sum of the various kinds of energy it contains:</p>
<p>
\(\displaystyle E^{tot} = E^{kinetic} + U^{potential} + U^{internal}+U^{chemical} + U^{nuclear}&#160; + \dots \) </p>

<p>
							You may wonder why we haven't listed the mass as contributing to the total energy via <i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. At a fundamental level, <i>E</i> = <i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup> says that the mass reflects the total energy. Consequently, the various forms of energy listed above all contribute to the mass. For example, the mass of a body increases slightly if it is heated, two hydrogen atoms combining have more mass (by a part per billion) than the <i>H</i><sub>2</sub> molecule they combine to form. In the non-relativistic limit of classical mechanics, mass is taken to be constant and unchanging, and other forms of energy are considered separately (and in detail).</p>

<h3>
Change of Total Energy</h3>
<p>
			For an isolated system the total energy is constant (conserved) - it can only change from one type of energy to another. For example, friction may reduce kinetic energy and increase internal (thermal) energy; a chemical reaction might heat the entire system, increasing its internal energy; an explosion might convert chemical energy into kinetic energy of the fragments. If the system contains a heat engine, some thermal energy might be turned back into mechanical energy, etc..</p>
<p>
			To change the total energy of a system, one must pass energy through the boundaries of the system. Historically nuclear energy was unknown, and chemical energy and radiative energy were only changed into heat. Thus the most important source/sink of mechanical energy was heat. This is true in mechanical systems as well, where mechanical energy lost due to friction and drag is transformed into heat.</p>
<p>
			In the early 19th century, Thermodynamics was developed to include the transfer of mechanical energy into/from heat. The law of change involving mechanical energy, work, and heat became the First Law of Thermodynamics. We now present the vocabulary and the model for "Total Energy", even though it won't be used in Introductory Mechanics unless we consider statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of ideal gasses.</p>

<tr style="display:none" id="ht2">
<td>
<p>
							The first law applies to systems containing many massive bodies and gasses. The internal energy (mechanical plus thermal) of these systems can be changed by external work done or by added heat.</p>
<p>
<br/>
\[E_{f} = E_{i} + Q_{f,i}+ W_{f,i} \]</p>
<p>
							This equation is called the First Law of Thermodynamics. Note that the subscript on the energy before and after is a single letter - this stresses that energy is a property of the system that depends only on it's state at a given time; f and i are the final and initial states of the system. Heat and Work, on the other hand, are processes and therefore depend on the details of the path taken to the final state from the initial state. This is designated here by the notation f,i for their subscripts.</p>
<p>
							Traditionally this law is written,</p>
<p>
\[dU= \delta Q-\delta W\]</p>
<p>
							where dU is the internal energy (really just the mechanical energy if you consider gasses and solids to be made up of atoms that can have kinetic and potential energy). The sign of \(\delta W\) is negative because historically the developers of steam engines were interested in the work done &#8216;&#8217;by the engine&#8217;&#8217; on the world (whereas in mechanics, we consider the work to be done &#8216;&#8217;by the environment&#8217;&#8217; on the system).</p>

<tr style="display:none" id="ht5">
<td>
<p>
							The world is awaking to the "energy crisis". Sometimes this is attributed to the fact that total energy is conserved &#8211; so the world has a finite supply of energy. This is not true because the sun adds radiant energy to the earth constantly. The solar constant is about 1.36 kilowatt per square meter, which translates to about 10,000 kilowatts per person after allowing for losses due to atmospheric absorption and reflection by clouds. Since even Americans use only about 3kW/person (night and day), there&#8217;s plenty of energy available. What is in llimited supply is easily usable, concentrated, energy that you can easily convert to useful mechanical or electrical energy. Chemical energy stored in fuels or batteries are prime examples. You have to pay for such energy, in contrast to other physical quantities like momentum, angular momentum, or velocity.</p>

<b>Why energy is a difficult topic</b> [<a href="javascript:toggleDisplay('ht6','hide','show')" id="ht6l">show</a>]</th>

<tr style="display:none" id="ht6">
<td>
<p>
							Because people did not understand that heat was a form of energy until the 19th century (they thought it was a sort of fluid called Phlogisten), they didn't understand that total energy is conserved, and didn't know how to tell if a particular mechanical system would conserve mechanical energy. Once heat was recognized as energy, the failure of attempts to convert it efficiently to mechanical energy led to Thermodynamics, which gave an unexpected theoretical limit to the efficiency of this conversion (the Carnot efficiency).</p>
<p>
							In part because of the difficulty of the concepts of heat and thermal energy, energy is conceptually difficult, as reflected in the fact that momentum was understood in <i>Principia</i>, published in 1684, whereas energy was not understood until ~150 years later. Don&#8217;t feel bad if you&#8217;re confused when your teacher asks you to learn these two subjects in less than a month!</p>
