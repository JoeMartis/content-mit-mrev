<h3>
Kinetic Energy and Work: One-dimensional Motion with Constant Force</h3>
<p>
			In this module, we motivate the definition of (translational) kinetic energy by exploring the consequences of applying a force to an object over a specified distance.</p>
<p>
			The <b>kinetic energy</b> <var>K</var> of a body is a state function of its speed <i> v </i> and its mass <i> m </i>:</p>
<p>
\( K = \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}\;\)</p>
<p>
			Consider a purely one-dimensional situation in which a constant net force acting in the x-direction <var>F<sub>net,x</sub></var> is applied to a block of mass <var>m</var> with an initial x-velocity <var>v<sub>i</sub></var> over a displacement &#916;<var>x</var>.</p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit8/Module1/files/WorkKineticIntro.png"/>
<p>
			A short derivation (see box) shows that the final velocity satisfies:</p>
<p>
\( \frac{1}{2} mv_{f}^{2} = \frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} + F_{net,x}\; \Delta x\)</p>

						Derivation using One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration [<a href="javascript:toggleDisplay('ht1','hide','show')" id="ht1l">show</a>]</th>
</tr>
<tr style="display:none" id="ht1">
<td>
						Given that a constant net force will produce a constant acceleration, we can use our One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration which says:
						<p>
\( v_{f}^{2} = v_{i}^{2} + 2 a_{x} \Delta x \)</p>
<p>
							Dividing both sides by 2 and multiplying by the mass, then using F = ma, gives exactly the result quoted above.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
			Using the definition of kinetic energy, we can rewrite the relationship above as:</p>
<p>
\( \Delta K = K_f - K_i = F_{net,x} \Delta x\)</p>
<p>
			The term on right-hand side is called the <b> work </b> <var> W. </var></p>
<h3>
Work</h3>
<p>
			In the example above, the work done by the force is <var>F<sub>net,x</sub></var>&#916;<var>x</var>. The speed or kinetic energy of the object changes because there is a component of the force along the direction of motion acting over some distance. The work quantifies the change of the kinetic energy produced by a force being applied along a given path between an initial and a final position. In summary,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>
				The work is the cause of the change in the kinetic energy of the object</li>
<li>
				The work depends on the component of the force along the displacement vector</li>
<li>
				The work depends on the initial and final position.</li>
</ol>
<h4>
The Units of Work and Energy</h4>
<p>
			The SI unit of energy is the Joule (J): \( \mathcal{}1\mbox{ Joule} = 1 \mbox{kg m}^{2}\mbox{/s}^{2} = 1 \mbox{N m} \)</p>
<h3>
Kinetic Energy is Additive in a Multi-Body System</h3>
<p>
			The total kinetic energy of a system composed of several objects is the sum of the individual kinetic energies of the objects. If a rigid body is rotating, one has to add up the kinetic energy of all its mass points to get the total kinetic energy. In this case you will learn that the kinetic energy has a contributions from both translational and angular velocity.</p>
<h3>
			Important Points about the Relation between Work and Kinetic Energy</h3>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit8/Module1/files/WorkKineticIntro1.png"/>
<p>
<i>The only type of energy considered here so far is kinetic</i> - this relationship is really a special case of the forthcoming &#8220;Mechanical Energy and Non-conservative Work&#8221; model which also involves <i>potential energy</i>.</p>
<p>
<i>Work is from all forces</i> - the work here is due to all forces, especially including gravitational and spring forces which will later be incorporated into appropriate potential energies with the result that no longer will be included in the calculation of the work (only work done by <i>non-conservative</i> forces must then be considered.)</p>
<p>
			This relationship is often called the work-energy theorem. Since there is a mathematical derivation for all of the concepts we introduce in this course, e.g. total mechanical energy, angular momentum, etc. that is as rigorous as the one here, it is inconsistent to call this one a theorem unless one also calls every other core model of mechanics a theorem.</p>
<p>
			This equation has the form of a law of change, with 1/2<var>mv</var><sup>2</sup> playing the role of the motion descriptor and <var>F<sub>net,x</sub></var>&#916;<var>x</var> accounting for the interactions.</p>
