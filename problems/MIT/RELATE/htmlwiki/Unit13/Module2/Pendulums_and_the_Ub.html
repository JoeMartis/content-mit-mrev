<h2>Pendulums and the Ubiquity of SHM</h2>
<h3> Learning Goals</h3>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none"><li>State the form of the differential equation that gives rise to simple harmonic oscillation.
</li><li>Explain why pendulums only produce harmonic oscillation when the amplitude is small.
</li></ul>
<h3> Same Differential Equation Equals Same Solution</h3>
<p>Before we discuss pendulums, it is important to take a step back and discuss the reasons for taking a course in classical mechanics.  Most people with a vested interest in the curriculum cite the development of "problem solving skills" as a major focus of this course.  One great advantage of this course for teaching problem solving skills is that many students have a physical intuition about the behavior of the systems studied in mechanics.  Thus, when we present the various equations of the One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration
 Model, for example, students can use their physical intuition to understand the mathematical structure of these equations.  This is valuable, because 
 the equations of the Models we present in this course are all solutions to differential equations.  In the case of the 
 One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration Model, the relevant differential equation is:
</p><p>\[\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} = {\rm constant}\]
</p><p>Once a physical interpretation is put to these solutions, it can be used to understand other processes that are <i>physically</i> completely 
different but have the same mathematical form.  We have already done this when we studied the topic of
Angular Motion about a Single Axis with Constant Angular Acceleration.  Physically, this is not the same as linear motion with constant acceleration.  If 
you showed the two motions to children, they would never notice a similarity.  Mathematically, however, the motions are nearly identical.  We simply write:
</p><p>\[\frac{d^{2}\theta_{a}}{dt^{2}} = {\rm constant}\]
</p><p>in place of the equation above.  Thus, our study of angular motion with constant acceleration was almost an afterthought.  Having developed a familiarity with the governing equation at the beginning of the course, the resulting intuition makes it much easier to understand the analogous motion in an angular system.
