Two NBA players are revered for their ability to dunk a basketball, i.e., both players can jump very high. The first player is a tall, heavy center, and the second player is an average height, slim guard.  The first player is 1.5 times the mass of the second player, and the first player jumps a maximum of 0.4 times as high as the second player's maximum jump.  Which player imparts the most impulse when jumping to their respective maximum vertical leaps?
