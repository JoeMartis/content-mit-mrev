The following questions are designed to gauge your overall preparation for this course.  It will help the instructors learn about you and about the course itself.
In order to achieve this purpose, it is important that you provide the best answers you can to the questions in the survey.  All the questions in the survey are conceptual, 
not requiring any math to answer them. Your specific answers to these questions will not be graded and you will not be penalized for wrong answers.

<p>Consider the situation shown in the picture above:  a person is trying to move a very heavy safe by pushing it along the ground.  The force applied by the person to the safe is perfectly horizontal.  Neither the person nor the safe is moving.  The following four questions refer to this situation.</p>
<br/>
<part loncapaid="18"><p>1.)  The friction force acting on the safe from the ground and the friction force acting on the person from the ground are:</p><br/><multiplechoiceresponse max="10" direction="vertical" randomize="yes" loncapaid="19" type="MultipleChoice"><choicegroup type="MultipleChoice"><choice location="random" name="a" correct="false">Equal in size because of Newton's Second Law applied to the person.</choice><choice location="random" name="b" correct="false">
Equal in size because of Newton's Second Law applied to the safe.
</choice><choice location="random" name="c" correct="true">
Equal in size because of Newton's Second Law applied to the safe plus the person as a single system.
</choice><choice location="random" name="d" correct="false">
Equal in size because of Newton's Third Law.
</choice></choicegroup><hintgroup showoncorrect="no"><br/></hintgroup></multiplechoiceresponse></part><p><br/>Now, suppose that suddenly the safe shown in the picture above begins to <b>accelerate to the right</b>, and the person follows along maintaining their force on the safe.  <br/></p>
<part loncapaid="22"><p>2.)  Which of the following pairs of forces remains equal?</p><br/><multiplechoiceresponse max="10" direction="vertical" randomize="yes" loncapaid="23" type="MultipleChoice"><choicegroup type="MultipleChoice"><choice location="random" name="a" correct="false">Friction on the person and force from safe on person.</choice><choice location="random" name="b" correct="false">
Friction on the safe and force from person on safe.
</choice><choice location="random" name="c" correct="true">
Force from person on safe and force from safe on person.
</choice><choice location="random" name="d" correct="false">
Friction on the safe and friction on the person.
</choice><choice location="random" name="e" correct="false">
None of the pairs listed above remain equal.

<part loncapaid="12"><p>3.)  The pendulum shown in the figure above (mass M at the end of a string of length L) is released from rest when the string is perfectly horizontal and swings down to hit the box (mass m &gt; M). The pendulum string is vertical when the collision occurs. The pendulum stops after it hits the box, and the box slides a distance d along a rough horizontal surface until it stops. The drawing above shows the beginning and end of the motion of the pendulum and the box. You are asked to find the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the surface using the quantities described in the problem plus the gravitational acceleration \(g\). What is the most appropriate way to decompose this problem?</p><br/><multiplechoiceresponse max="10" direction="vertical" randomize="yes" loncapaid="13" type="MultipleChoice"><choicegroup type="MultipleChoice"><choice location="random" name="a" correct="false">One problem: 1-7</choice><choice location="random" name="b" correct="false">

<part loncapaid="14"><br/><p>4.) My answer to the previous question is justified because:</p><br/><multiplechoiceresponse max="10" direction="vertical" randomize="yes" loncapaid="15" type="MultipleChoice"><choicegroup type="MultipleChoice"><choice location="random" name="a" correct="true">The work done by the collision forces is unknown.</choice><choice location="random" name="b" correct="false">
Mechanical energy is conserved throughout.

Mechanical energy is not conserved when the block is sliding.
</choice><choice location="random" name="d" correct="false">
The collision is elastic.
