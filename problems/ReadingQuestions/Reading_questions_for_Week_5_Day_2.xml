  <p><b class="bfseries">(1) </b>Explain the difference between a conservative force and a non-conservative force. Give one example of each type and explain why. </p>
  <p><b class="bfseries">(2) </b>In section 13.3, gravitational potential energy difference \(U(r_{2} )-U(r_{1} )\) is defined as the negative of the work done by the earth's gravitational force in moving an object from one point, a distance \(r=r_{1}\) from the center of the earth, to another point, a distance \(r=r_{2}\) from the center of the earth. Eq. 13.9 gives a general expression for the gravitational potential energy. At what point have we chosen \(U=0\) in order for Eq. 13.9 to give a general expression for the gravitational potential energy? </p>
