You are walking on a level field at a constant speed holding a ball. The air is still, no wind. You decide to try an experiment. You first make sure no one is in front of you. As you are walking you close your eyes and throw the ball straight up into the air (relative to you) about three meters and keep your throwing hand in the exact same position as when you released the ball. You are surprised that after a short interval of time the ball hits your hand. (i) Explain why.<shortanswerresponse><textbox rows="10"/></shortanswerresponse> </p>
  <p>
(ii) Now suppose that you throw the ball much higher, ten meters, but still perfectly straight up relative to you. Would you expect the ball to hit your hand? <optionresponse><optioninput options="('yes','no')" correct="no"/></optionresponse> </p>
  <p>
Explain why or why not? In particular, explain any assumptions that you made in either case.<shortanswerresponse><textbox rows="10"/></shortanswerresponse> </p>
