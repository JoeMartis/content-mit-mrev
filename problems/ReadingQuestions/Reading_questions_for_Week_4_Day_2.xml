1. Explain how you would apply Newton's Second Law for a spacecraft undergoing uniform circular motion about a planet. What quantities could you predict if you know the mass of the spacecraft, the mass of the planet, and the radius of the circular orbit? </p>
  <p>
2. Suppose a car is traveling around a banked curve at a speed such that no friction is needed to maintain the car's turning radius. Suppose the angle of the banked turn suddenly increased, would the driver have to speed up or slow down in order not to slide up or down the embankment? Explain your reasoning. </p>
