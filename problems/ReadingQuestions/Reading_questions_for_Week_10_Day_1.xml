  </p>
  <p>
(1) In your own words, explain the concept of angular momentum based on an example of your choice. In particular do not write down a formula but explain the meaning of each term in the formula and the direction of the angular momentum. </p>
  <p>
(2) This question is a challenge. Suppose you have a collection of moving point-like particles. You are in the center of mass reference frame i.e. you are moving with the same velocity as the center of mass. You would like to compute the angular momentum of the system of particles. You recall that the definition of angular momentum depends on choosing a point about which to compute the angular momentum. A friend tells you that in the center-of-mass reference frame the angular momentum is the same about every point. Is your friend right or wrong? Justify your answer. </p>
