  <p><b class="bfseries">(1) </b>For an object moving in a circle of radius \(R\) at constant speed \(v\) , explain why the derivative of the velocity vector points towards the center of the circle and has magnitude \(v^{2} /R\) . </p>
  <p><b class="bfseries">(2) </b>In order to answer this question please read the Course Notes: Circular Motion Kinematics. In a polar coordinate system, consider a point-like object traveling in a circle in the \(z=0\) plane centered about the origin. (a) Do the unit vectors \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) and point in the same direction at every point on the circular path? (b) Write down a vector description for it's position, velocity, and acceleration in polar coordinates. </p>
