  <p>
(1) Explain why if the relative velocity of two bodies undergoing a collision is the same before and after the collision, then the collision is elastic. </p>
  <p>
(2) Two carts undergo a collision. The motion sensor is on the left and the force sensor is on the right. </p>

  <p>
The upper graph below is a plot of the force vs. time as detected by the force sensor and the lower graph is a plot of the velocity vs. time as determined by the motion sensor. Based on the information in the plots (i) describe the motion of both carts, (ii) is the collision elastic or inelastic, (iii) is the mass of object 1 greater, equal, or less than the mass of object 2? </p>
