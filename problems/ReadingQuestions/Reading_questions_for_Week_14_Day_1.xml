  <p>
1) (a) Explain how the angular momentum about a point can change in time if the magnitude of the angular momentum is constant. (b) Describe two examples in circular motion kinematics of a vector that is constant in length but changes in time. </p>
  <p>
2) (a) Explain how the angular momentum about the pivot point of a precessing gyroscope changes in time. (b) For a precessing gyroscope what force produces the torque about the pivot point? (c) Is this torque constant in time? Explain your answer. </p>
