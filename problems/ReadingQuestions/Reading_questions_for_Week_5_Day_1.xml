  <p><b class="bfseries">(1) </b>The work-energy theorem for straight-line motion applies for varying forces as well as constant forces. (a) Explain why the work-energy theorem is valid even without the assumption that the net force is constant. (b) How would you generalize the work-energy theorem for a force that varies in direction as well as magnitude and the displacement lies along a curved path? </p>
  <p><b class="bfseries">(2) </b>(a) What is the definition for a conservative force? (b) In your own words define the potential energy difference between two points for a conservative force. </p>
