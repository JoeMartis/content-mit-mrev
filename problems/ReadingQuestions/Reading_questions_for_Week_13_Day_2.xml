  <p>
(1) In Young and Freedman section 14.5, the angle \(\theta\) is introduced to describe the motion of the simple pendulum and we have already used the symbol \(\omega\) for angular speed \(\omega =d\theta /dt\) . The symbol \(\omega\) is also used to describe the angular frequency \(\omega =2\pi /T\) . Explain the difference between angular speed and angular frequency for the simple pendulum for motion in which the angle \(\theta\) is small. </p>
  <p>
(2) Explain how a mechanical watch based on a spring keeps time. Is a small angle approximation used in this case? (b) Explain how you can measure the moment of inertia of a complicated shaped object by treating it as a physical pendulum. </p>
