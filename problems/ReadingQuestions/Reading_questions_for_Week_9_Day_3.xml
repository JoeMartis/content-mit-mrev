  <p>
(1) What re the two conditions for static equilibrium of a rigid body? </p>
  <p>
(2) When applying the torque equation when there is fixed axis rotation about the z-axis, both torque and angular acceleration are vectors. The \(z\) -component of angular acceleration is defined to be \(\alpha _{z} =d^{2} \theta /dt^{2} =d\omega _{z} /dt\) . How does your choice of direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) for increasing angle \(\theta\) determine which direction you choose for the positive \(z\) -axis? Keep in mind that these choices will determine the sign of the \(z\) -component of the torque. </p>
