  <p>
1. When solving problems involving circular motion, you are often given the speed, period, angular speed, or frequency of the rotating object. How does that information help you predict what forces are acting on the object? </p>
  <p>
2. Up to now we have mostly considered problems involving massless strings held under a constant tension (except the capstan problem, see W03D1 daily page for solution). In today's problem solving session you will calculate how the tension varies with radius for a rope with non-zero mass rotating in a circle at constant speed (we will ignore gravitational effects). Explain qualitatively why you expect the tension to vary with radius. </p>
