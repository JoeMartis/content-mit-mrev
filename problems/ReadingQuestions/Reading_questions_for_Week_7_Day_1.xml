  <p>
(1) Suppose a system of particles undergoes a collision. Why is it possible for the kinetic energy of the system to increase if the potential energy does not change during the collision? Can you think of an example of such a system and collision? </p>
  <p>
(2) When an object is thrown from a cart that is at rest on a frictionless surface with speed \(u\) relative to the cart, is the speed of the object with respect to the ground greater, equal, or less than the speed \(u\) (relative to the cart ). </p>
