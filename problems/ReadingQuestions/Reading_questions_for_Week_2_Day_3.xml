You throw a small stone in a parabolic trajectory at an given angle \(\theta _{i}\) with respect to the horizontal with an unknown speed \(v_{i}\) . After waiting a short interval of time \(\Delta t\) you accelerate at a given non-constant rate that increases linearly with time in the horizontal direction that you threw the stone and are able to catch the stone at exactly the same height while you are still accelerating. You may neglect air resistance. </p>

(i) Describe a strategy for finding the unknown speed \(v_{i}\) . You do not have to solve it. <stringresponse answer="unknown"><textline size="80"/></stringresponse> </p>
