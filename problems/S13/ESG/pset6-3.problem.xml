	<h2>A Two Block Swing</h2>
	<p> A box of mass M is at rest on a horizontal table. The coefficient of static friction between the box and the table is \(\mu\). The box is connected by a taut string to a block of unknown mass m, initially held horizontally as shown and then released. The box begins to slide at the instant the block reaches the bottom point of its swing.</p>
	<script type="loncapa/python">
m = "M*mu/2"
