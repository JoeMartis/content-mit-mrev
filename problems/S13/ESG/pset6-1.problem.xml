	<h2>Block-Spring on a Rough Surface</h2>
	<p>A block of mass <i>m</i>  slides along a horizontal table with speed <i>u</i>. At <i>x</i> = 0 it hits a spring
	 with spring constant <i>k</i> . At this point, the spring is neither stretched nor compressed.  As the block moves, the spring
	  gets compressed. The surface on which the block moves exerts a friction force on it. The coefficient of friction is 
	  <i>variable</i> and is given by \( \mu \) = <i>bx</i> , where <i>b</i> is a positive constant. </p>
	
	<p>Find the change in mechanical energy of the block-spring system from <i>x</i> = 0 until the block first momentarily comes to rest.</p>
