		<h2>Two rotating balls</h2>
		<p>Two balls, A and B, with masses m<sub>A</sub> and m<sub>B</sub> are connected by a taut, massless string, and are 
		moving along a horizontal frictionless plane. The plane is parallel to the screen and gravity points into the screen.
		The distance between the centers of the two balls is L. At a certain instant, the velocity of ball B has magnitude V 
		and is directed perpendicular to the string and parallel to the horizontal plane, and the velocity of ball A is zero. </p>
		<p>The goal is to find the force of tension in terms of m<sub>A</sub>, m<sub>B</sub>, V and L. </p>
		<p>Hint: before you start solving the problem describe the motion of the balls.</p>
		<p>Type mA for m<sub>A</sub>, mB for m<sub>B</sub>.</p>
