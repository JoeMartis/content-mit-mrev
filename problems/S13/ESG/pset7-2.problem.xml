	<h2> A cart and a spring on an incline.</h2>

	<p>An ideal spring is attached to a support at the upper end of a ramp. The spring constant of the spring is <i>k</i>. 
	The unstretched length of the spring (without the cart attached to it) is <i>l<sub>o</sub></i>. The other end of the spring 
	is now attached to a cart of mass <i>m</i> that can move on the ramp. The ramp is inclined at an angle \(\theta\) from the horizontal.</p>
	<p>In your answers you can type "l_o" for \(l_o\), "theta" for \(\theta\), "x_1" for \(x_1\), and "muk" for \(\mu\)<sub>k</sub>.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>

	<p>When the cart is attached to the spring, the spring stretches slightly to a new length \(l > l_o\) to hold the cart in 
	equilibrium. Find the length \(l \) in terms of the given quantities: \(l_o\), \(m\), \(k\), \(\theta\) and \(g\).</p>

<p>
</p>
	<h3>Part 2</h3>

	<p>Now the cart is moved up the ramp so that the spring is compressed a distance \(x_1\) from the unstretched length 
	\(l_o\). Then the cart is released from rest. As the cart moves down the ramp, the spring stretches a maximum distance 
	of \(x_2\)  from its starting compressed position after which the cart turns around and comes back up the ramp. </p>

	<p>Assuming there is no friction between the cart and the ramp, what is the speed of the cart when the spring has  
	returned to its unstretched length \(l_o\) for the <b>second</b> time? (At the instant when the car is moving up and passing through 
	the spring equilibrium position for the 2nd time after it was released). </p>

	<h3>Part 3</h3>

	<p>Assuming there is a constant coefficient of friction \( \mu_k \) between the cart and the ramp, what is the speed of the cart 
	when when the spring has returned to its unstretched length \(l_o\) for the <b>first</b> time? (At the instant when the car is moving down
	and passing through the spring's equilibrium position for the 1st time after it was released).</p>
