	<h2>Checkpoint 19</h2>
	<p>The system shown in the diagram contains two blocks, of masses M and 3M, connected by a light string over a pulley of radius r.  The pulleyâ€™s rotational inertia about its center is I. The block of mass 3M is free to slide on a horizontal frictionless surface and the pulley is free to rotate on a frictionless fixed horizontal axle passing through its center. The string connecting the blocks does not slip on the pulley. The system is released from rest.</p>
