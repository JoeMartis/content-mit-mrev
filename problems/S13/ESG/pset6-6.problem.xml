	<h2>Rocket Problem</h2>
	<p>Not checked. We are not covering this topic</p>
	<p>A rocket ascends from rest in a uniform gravitational field by ejecting exhaust at constant speed <i>u</i> relative to the rocket. Assume that the rate at which mass is expelled is give by:</p>
	
	<p> \( \frac{dm_f}{dt} = \gamma m_r \) </p>
	
	<!-- <img src="/static/problems/S13/ESG/images/6-6.png" /> -->
	
	<p>where <i>m<sub>r</sub></i> is the instantaneous mass of the rocket and \(\gamma\) is a positive constant. The rocket is retarded by air resistance with a force <i>F = bm<sub>r</sub>v<sub>r</sub></i> proportional to the instantaneous momentum of the rocket where <i>b</i> is a positive constant and <i>v<sub>r</sub></i> is the speed of the rocket.</p>
	
	<script type="loncapa/python">
v = "(gamma*u-g)/b*(1-e^(b*t))"
	</script>
	
	 <p>Find the speed of the rocket as a function of time.</p>
