	<h2>Space Junk. </h2>
	<p>Not checked because we are not covering this topic, are we?</p>
	<p>A Spacecraft of cross-sectional area <i>A</i>, proceeding along the positive <i>x</i>-direction, enters an asteroid storm at time <i>t</i>=0, in which the mean mass density of the asteroid storm is \(\rho\) and the average asteroid velocity is \(\vec{u}\) = <i>-u</i>\(\vec{i}\) in the negative <i>x</i>-direction.  As the spacecraft proceeds through the storm, all of the asteroids that hit the spacecraft stick to it.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Suppose that at time <i>t</i> the velocity of the spacecraft is \(\vec{v}\) = <i>v</i>\(\vec{i}\) in the positive <i>x</i>-direction, and its mass is <i>m</i>. Further, suppose that in an interval \(\Delta\)<i>t</i>, the mass of the spacecraft increases by an amount \(\Delta\)<i>m</i>. Given that there are no external forces, using conservation of momentum find an equation for the change of the spacecraft velocity \(\Delta\)<i>v</i>, in terms of  m, \(\Delta\)m, u, and v?</p>
	<p>You may type "Deltam" for \(\Delta\) m.</p>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>	
	<p>When the spacecraft enters the asteroid storm, the magnitude of its velocity and mass are <i>v<sub>0</sub></i>  and <i>m<sub>0</sub></i> , respectively. Integrate your differential equation in part 1 to find the velocity <i>v</i> of the spacecraft when the mass is <i>m</i>.</p>
	<p>You may type "m0" for m<sub>0</sub>.</p>

	<h3>Part 3</h3>	
	<p>Find an expression for the mass of the asteroids \(\Delta\)m that sticks to the spacecraft within the time interval \(\Delta\)t? (Hint: consider the volume of asteroids swept up by the spacecraft in time \(\Delta\) t). </p>
	<p>You may type "rho" for \(\rho\) and "Deltat" for \(\Delta\) t.</p>

	<h3>Part 4</h3>
	<p>When the spacecraft enters the asteroid storm, the magnitude of its velocity and mass are <i>v<sub>0</sub></i>  and <i>m<sub>0</sub></i> , respectively. What is the mass of the spacecraft at time <i>t</i> ? (Use your results from parts 2 and 3.)</p>
	<p>You may type "m0" for m<sub>0</sub>, "v0" for v<sub>0</sub>, and "rho" for \(\rho\).</p>
