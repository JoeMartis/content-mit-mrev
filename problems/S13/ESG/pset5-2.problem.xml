	<h2>Two Blocks</h2>
	
	<p>Two identical bullets are fired with identical speeds  at two blocks of equal mass. The blocks are initially at rest on a 
	frictionless horizontal surface and are made of steel and wood respectively. One bullet bounces back elastically off the steel 
	block. The other bullet gets embedded in the wooden block. Each block moves in the same direction after the collision. 
	The arrows in the picture below only represent the direction of the motion. Gravity is into the screen.</p>

	<h3> Part 1 </h3>
	<optionresponse direction="vertical" randomize="no">
		<p>
			Consider the system to be the bullet and the steel block. Which of the following is constant during the collision between the bullet and the steel block: 
			<optioninput inline="1" options="('Momentum','Mechanical Energy', 'Both Momentum and Mechanical Energy', 'Neither Momentum nor Mechanical Energy')" correct="Both Momentum and Mechanical Energy"/>
		</p>
	<h3> Part 2 </h3>
		<p>
			Consider the system to be the bullet and the wood block. Which of the following is constant during the collision between the bullet and the wood block: 
			<optioninput options="('Momentum','Mechanical Energy', 'Both Momentum and Mechanical Energy', 'Neither Momentum nor Mechanical Energy')" correct="Momentum"/>
