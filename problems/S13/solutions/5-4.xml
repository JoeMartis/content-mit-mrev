<!--BALLS SLIDING ON TABLE-->

<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>i) The x-component of momentum of ball 2. – Graph E: zero before, positive after</p>
<p>ii) The y-component of momentum of ball 1. – Graph E: zero before, positive after.</p>
<p>iii) The y-component of momentum of ball 2. – Graph C: zero before, negative after.</p>
<p>iv) The x-component of momentum of ball 1. – Graph B: large positive before, smaller positive value after collision.</p>
<p>v) The x-component of total momentum. – Graph A, since this is a constant positive number, before and after.</p>
<p>vi) The y-component of total momentum. – None of the graphs, since the y-component of total momentum is zero before and after.</p>
