A block of mass <i>m</i> is pushed against a horizontal spring of negligible mass until the spring is compressed a distance <i>d</i>. 
The force constant of the spring is <i>k</i>. When it is released, the block travels along a frictionless, horizontal surface to 
point A, the bottom of a vertical circular track of radius <i>R</i> and continues to move up along the track. The block 
experiences an average friction force while sliding up the track. The magnitude of the average force was found to be \(F = c\frac{mg}{2\pi}\), 
where \(c \) is a positive constant.<br/>

What should be the minimum value of <i>d</i> for the block  to complete one turn?
