<p>A uniform disc of radius <i>R</i> and mass <i>m1</i> is rotating with an angular speed \(\omega_o\) about an axis passing 
through its center and perpendicular to the disc's plane. A small animated box of mass <i>m2</i>, initially at the center of 
the disc,moves away from the center and stops moving relative to the disc when it is at a distance <i>R</i>/2 from the
disc's center. </p>

<p>What is the angular speed of the disc - block system at the instant when the block stops moving relative to 
the disc? Express your answer in terms of all or some of the variables <i>R</i>, <i>m1</i>, <i>m2</i> and \(\omega_o\).
 In your answer enter omega_o for \(\omega_o\).</p>
