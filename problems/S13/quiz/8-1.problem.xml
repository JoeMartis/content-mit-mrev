<!-- Energy in a pulley system -->

<problem>

<img src="/static/problems/S13/quiz/images/3-2.png" />

<p>Two masses, m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>, are hung over a pulley as shown. Assume that m<sub>1</sub> is heavier, that the pulley is massless and frictionless, and that the rope does not slip. Determine the velocity of m<sub>1</sub> after it has fallen a distance of d meters. You may enter "m_1" for m1 and "m_2" for m2.</p>

<script type="loncapa/python">
from __future__ import division
vfinal = "sqrt((2*(m_1-m_2)*g*d)/(m_1+m_2))"
</script>

<formularesponse type="ci" samples="m_1,m_2,g,d@6,1,9,1:10,5,10,10#10" answer="$vfinal">
	<responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.001"/> 
	<textline size="40" math="1" />
