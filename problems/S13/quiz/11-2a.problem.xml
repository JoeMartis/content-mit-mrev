<p> <b> This problem can lead to frustration because of the calculations - I will not use it for a quiz</b></p>
<p>In this problem you will estimate the possible effect of the melting of the Earth's polar ice caps on the duration of one day.
Assume that the polar ice has a mass of 2.30x10^19 kg and form two flat disks of radius 6.00x105 m. Assume that the ice melts completely
and that the water spreads into an unbroken thin spherical shell. What is the change in the duration of a day? Enter your answer in seconds.
</p><p>Assume that the moment of inertia of the Earth is 8.04×10<sup>37<sup> kg·m<sup>2</sup>.
ans 0.55 s
