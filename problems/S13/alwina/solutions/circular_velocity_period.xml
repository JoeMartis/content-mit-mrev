<!-- circular orbits: velocities and periods -->
<problem>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Planets closer-in to their stars orbit with higher velocities and shorter periods. Those with the same orbital radius will have the same velocities and periods, regardless of their mass.</p>
<p>Thus the ranking for the velocity is: C = D > A = B = E.</p>
<p>The ranking for the period is the opposite: A = B = E > C = D.</p>
