<p><b>Assumptions and consequences:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Ideal pulley \(\Rightarrow\) Same tension on either side of the pulley</li>
	<li>Rope is massless \(\Rightarrow\) Same tension at all points on the rope</li>
	<li>Rope is taut and does not stretch \(\Rightarrow\) the magnitude of the velocity is the same for both blocks</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the applied force is such that block B is moving at constant speed, the block A is also moving at a constant speed. Therefore the net force on both blocks must be zero. Using the coordinate system with the +x-axis to the right and +y-axis upwards (see figure above), then net force equal to zero on block A implies:</p>

<h4>Checks:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Dimensions</li>
	<li>If \(\mu_k = 0\) and the blocks were moving at constant velocity, no force is needed to the left to drag block B.</li>
	<li>If \(M_A = 0\), it means that the only force that opposes the dragging force \(F\) is the frictional force exerted by the ground on B, so \(F\) must be \(\mu_k N = \mu_k M_B g\)</li>
</ol>
