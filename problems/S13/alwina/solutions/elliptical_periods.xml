<!-- elliptical orbits: periods -->
<problem>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Kepler's 3rd Law states that the period of an orbit depends only on its semi-major axis (and some universal constants). This is true regardless of the shape of the orbit. Ranking the orbits by their semi-major axis is effectively the same as ranking them by period. You will find that F = D > C = E > B > A.</p>
