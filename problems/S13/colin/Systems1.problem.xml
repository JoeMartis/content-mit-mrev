<p>In the image above, two blocks are stacked on a flat plane. The stack is initially given a velocity to the right. The surface that block 2 slides on has friction, but the interface between blocks 1 and 2 has no friction.</p>

<p>Which choice of system will <b>not</b> be accelerating?</p>

	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
