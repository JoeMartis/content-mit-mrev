<p><b>REJECTED - problem is too complex because #3 swings.</b></p>

<p>In the image above, a large block rests on a flat plane. The large block has a pulley attached. A second block sits on top of the large block, and a rope runs from it, over the pulley, down to a third block that hangs from the pulley and touches the large block.</p>

<p>There is no friction on any surface. The system is arranged as shown and then released.</p>

<p>Which systems will <b>not</b> be accelerating in the <b>horizontal direction?</b></p>
