	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>You are building a missile defense system to shoot down ICBMs, nuclear missiles, that are fired on elliptical trajectories that can take them 
	anywhere on Earth. To simplify the problem, you may assume that the missiles do not burn fuel after they leave the atmosphere.</p>
	<p>It will be easiest to hit the missiles when they are moving slowly. When in their trajectory should you try to hit them?</p>
