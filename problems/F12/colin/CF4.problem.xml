	<p>A young sun has two planets. One planet is close to the sun, at a distance of $r1km kilometers. Its orbital period is $t1days days. Another is 
	farther away, at $r2km km, with an orbital period of $t2days days.</p>
	<p>This solar system also has a dust cloud. The solar wind and the formation of the inner planet have cleared the dust out from the center of the system, but a substantial amount of it still remains between the two planets. Use the information you have about the orbits of the planets to approximate the mass of the dust cloud.</p>
