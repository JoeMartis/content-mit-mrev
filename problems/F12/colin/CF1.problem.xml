r2 = random.randrange(200000000000,400000000000,1000000000)

	<p>The Earth orbits the sun at a distance of \( $r1disp \times 10^{11} \) meters. (Approximate the Earth's orbit as a circle for this problem.) You are part of a team that is launching a satellite that will orbit the sun at a distance of \( $r2disp \times 10^{11} \) meters.</p>
	<p>One way to do this is a very quick burn of the engines near Earth, putting the satellite into an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus. When the sattelite reaches the outside edge of that orbit, a second quick burn corrects its velocity and puts it into a circular orbit at the new radial distance. You can see this on the picture below.</p>

	<p>Using this type of transfer, how long (in days) will it take for the satellite to reach its new orbit?</p>
