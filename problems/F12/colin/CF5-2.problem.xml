			<choice location="random" correct="false">At this point, atmospheric drag will have slowed the missile down.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The acceleration from Earth's gravity will be the smallest here, so the rocket's speed will also be 
			the smallest.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Kepler's Second Law indicates that the missile's speed will be smallest here.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Newton's Third Law says that the missile and Earth put the same force on each other, which is 
			smallest here.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Kepler's Third Law relates the time the missile takes to its distance from Earth. The farther 
			up the missile is along its path, the more time it takes.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">At this distance gravity from the Moon will also be pulling on the missile, slowing it down.</choice>
