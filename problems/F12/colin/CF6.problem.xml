	<p>A merry-go-round (pictured) is sitting in a playground. It is free to rotate, but is currently stationary. You can model it as a cylinder of mass
	$bigm kg and radius $bigr cm. The poles near the edge are $littler cm from the center.</p>
	<img src="/static/problems/F12/colin/images/CF6.png" width="300" />
	<p>Someone hits one of the poles with a $littlem kg sledgehammer moving at $v m/s in a direction tangent to the edge of the merry-go-round. The hammer is not moving after it hits the merry-go-round.</p>
	<p>Find the angular velocity of the merry-go-round after it is struck.</p>
