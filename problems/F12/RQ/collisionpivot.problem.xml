  <p>
A long narrow uniform rod of length \(d\) and mass \(M\) lies motionless on ice. The rod is attached to a frictionless axle that goes through ice. 
A puck with the same mass \(M\) is sliding on ice with a speed \(v_0\) towards the rod. The puck collides with the rod and sticks to it, and the two objects start 
spinning around the axle. The rotation is contained within the plane of the screen. Gravity points into the screen.

During the collision, angular momentum of the system of both the puck and the rod is conserved around:
