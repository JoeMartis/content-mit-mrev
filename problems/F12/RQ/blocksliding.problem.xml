<p>A small cube of mass \(m_1\)  slides down a circular track of radius \(R\) cut into a large block of mass \(m_2\) as shown in the figure below. The large block rests on a frictionless table and there is no friction between the block and the cube. Both objects are initially at rest, and the cube starts from the top of the track as shown in the figure. Find the velocity  of the cube as it leaves the block.</p>

	<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
		<choice location="random" correct="false" name="1">Only use momentum and impulse. There is no net external impulse, so momentum of the cube+block system is constant. However, energy is not necessarily constant.</choice>
		<choice location="random" correct="false" name="2">Only use Mechanical Energy and Work. There is no non-conservative work, so Mechanical Energy of the cube+block+Earth system is constant. However, momentum is not necessarily constant.</choice>
		<choice location="random" correct="true" name="3">The mechanical energy of the cube+block+Earth system and the momentum along the horizontal direction of the cube+block system are constant. Apply both principles to solve for the velocity of the cube </choice>
		<choice location="bottom" correct="false" name="4">None of the above, there is not enough information to solve the problem.</choice>
