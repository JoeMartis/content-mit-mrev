A bike is going clockwise around a circle of radius  R (see below). The moment of inertia of each wheel around its center   \(I_{cm}\) is NOT negligible. What is the direction of the total Angular Momentum of the bike? Consider when the bike is at the location shown below , and use the directions described in the graph (e.g. vector 2 is pointing to the center of the circle, vector 3 is directed down -perpendicular to the plane-, etc).
