  <p>
A uniform cylinder of outer radius \(R\) and Mass \(M\) with moment of inertia about the center of mass \(I_{cm}\), starts from rest and moves down an 
incline tilted at an angle \(\beta\) from the horizontal. The center of mass of the cylinder has dropped a vertical distance \(h\) when it reached the bottom 
of the incline. Let \(g\) denote the gravitational constant. The coefficient of static friction between the cylinder and the surface is \(\mu_s\). The 
cylinder rolls without slipping down the incline. The goal of this problem is to find the magnitude of the velocity of the center of mass of the cylinder 
when it reaches the bottom of the incline.
