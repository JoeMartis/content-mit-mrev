  <p>
A Yo-Yo of mass \( m\) has an axle of radius  \(b\) and a spool of radius  \(R\) . It's moment of inertia about the center of mass can be taken to be  
\(I = (1/ 2)mR^2\) and the thickness of the string can be neglected. The string does not slip with respect to the axle. The Yo-Yo is released from rest.
 What is the relation between the angular acceleration about the center of mass and the linear acceleration of the center of mass?
