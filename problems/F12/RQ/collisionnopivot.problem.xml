  <p>
A long narrow uniform rod of length \(d\) and mass \(M\) lies motionless on ice. The rod is free to move within the plane of the screen and is not attached to anything.
 Gravity points into the screen. A puck has the same mass \(M\), and is 
sliding on ice with a speed \(v_0\) towards the rod. The puck collides with the rod and sticks to it, and the two start translating and rotating.

During the collision, angular momentum of the system of both the puck and the rod is conserved around (choose the best answer):
