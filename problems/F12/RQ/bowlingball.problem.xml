  <p>
A bowling ball of mass \(m\) and radius \(R\) is initially thrown down an alley with an initial speed \(v_0\), and it slides without rolling but due to 
friction it begins to roll.  </p>

During the time when the ball starts to roll because of friction, and before it starts rolling without slipping, angular momentum is conserved around:
