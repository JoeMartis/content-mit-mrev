<problem>
	
	<p>A system consists of two blocks, of masses m and 2m, attached to the ends of a massless spring with a force constant k. The system is placed on a horizontal frictionless surface. Initially, the spring is relaxed. The blocks are then pulled apart an “extra” distance x and released from the state of rest.</p>
