<!-- MRI problem 4b -->

<problem>

	<p>Consider the situation shown in the picture below: a person is trying to move a very heavy safe by pushing it along the ground. The force applied by the person to the safe is perfectly horizontal. Neither the person nor the safe is moving. </p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>The force applied by the person to the safe and the force applied by the safe to the person are:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Equal in size.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Not equal in size.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Otherwise the safe would break or dent.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The safe is much heavier than the person.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The system composed of the person and safe is not accelerating.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>
