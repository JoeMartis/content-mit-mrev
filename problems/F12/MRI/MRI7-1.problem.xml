	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>A toy rocket is launched at rest from the ground.  As long as the rocket has fuel, it accelerates upward with a constant rate <b>a</b>.  After a time
	<b> T</b>, the rocket suddenly runs out of fuel and its engine stops (this happens in time frame 3 in the figure).  Its engine remains off for the 
	remainder of the flight.  The goal of this problem is to determine the maximum height reached by the rocket.</p>
