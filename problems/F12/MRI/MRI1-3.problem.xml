	<p>Which of the following statements accurately describes the mechanical energy of the block-box-spring system during the time interval that starts at the instant at which the rope is cut, and ends at the instant at which the box is moving with speed V<sub>1</sub> and the block is moving with V<sub>2</sub>?</p>

			<choice location="random" correct="false"><p>The mechanical energy of the block-box-spring system must be conserved.</p></choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true"><p>The mechanical energy of the block-box-spring system is not conserved.></p></choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false"><p>The mechanical energy of the block-box-spring system is only conserved when m<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>.</p></choice>
