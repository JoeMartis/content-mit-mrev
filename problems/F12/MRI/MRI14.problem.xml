<!-- MRI problem 14 -->

<problem>
	
	<p>A system consists of two blocks, of masses m and 2m, attached to the ends of a massless spring with a force constant k. The system is placed on a 
	horizontal frictionless surface. Initially, the spring is relaxed. The blocks are then pulled apart an “extra” distance x and released from the state of rest.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>When the spring is relaxed again, what statement about their instantaneous speeds is correct?</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Block m has a greater speed</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Block 2m has a greater speed</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Both blocks have zero speed</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Both blocks have equal non-zero speed</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because at that moment, for the entire system:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The momentum is zero but the kinetic energy is not</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The kinetic energy is zero but the momentum is not</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The elastic energy and the momentum are both zero</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The elastic energy and the momentum are both non-zero</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>
