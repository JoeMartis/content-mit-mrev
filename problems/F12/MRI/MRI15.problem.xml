<!-- MRI problem 15 -->

<problem>
	
	<p>A system consists of two blocks, of masses m and 2m, attached to the ends of a massless spring with a force constant k. The system is placed on a horizontal frictionless surface. Initially, the spring is relaxed. The blocks are then pulled apart an “extra” distance x and released from the state of rest.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>As the blocks are moving toward each other, the center of mass of the system: </p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Is moving to the right</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Is moving to the left</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Is not moving</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The momentum of the system is conserved</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The momentum of the system is not conserved</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The more massive block experiences greater net force</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The less massive block experiences greater net force</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>
