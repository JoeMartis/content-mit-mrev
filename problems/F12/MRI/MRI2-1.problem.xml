<problem>

	<p>An astronaut is holding onto a long aluminum antenna attached to a deep-space probe which is floating freely far from any other object. The astronaut is initially at rest, but then begins to climb out along the antenna.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Which of the following statements accurately describes the linear momentum of the system containing the astronaut, antenna and space-probe during a time interval that starts when the astronaut is at rest and ends when the astronaut is in the process of climbing the antenna?</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The linear momentum of the astronaut, antenna and space-probe system is conserved.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The linear momentum of the astronaut, antenna and space-probe system is not conserved.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
