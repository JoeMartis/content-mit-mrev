<problem>
	
	<p>A projectile is launched at an angle from the ground level over a flat terrain. The horizontal range of the projectile is five times the maximum height of the flight.</p>
	
	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Consider the angle \(\theta\) that the initial velocity vector makes with the ground. What statement about angle \(\theta\) is correct?</p>

		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">\(\theta = 45\deg \)</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">\(\theta\) is greater than \(45\deg \)</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">\(\theta\) is less than \(45\deg \)</choice>
		</choicegroup>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>Which of the following statements about \(\theta\) is correct? </p>

		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The information given in the problem is sufficient to calculate \(\theta\)</choice>
