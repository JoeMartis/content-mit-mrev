<!-- MRI problem 35 -->

<problem>
	
	<p>Two bugs ride on a bicycle wheel as the bike travels. One is near the center; the other is near the edge of the wheel. Because of this, they take paths as shown below:</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Over the course of a single turn of the wheel, which bug experiences a greater average force?</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The bug on the outer edge.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The bug near the center.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Both experience the same force.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The inner bug needs a greater force to keep itself above the ground all the time.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The inner bug will need more  force to keep itself moving in a smaller circle.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The outer bug will need more  force because of its higher speed.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The outer bugâ€™s trajectory has a sharp point at the bottom, which requires substantial force to create.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The outer bug moves up and down more, which requires more force.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Both bugs feel gravity and the centripetal force, so both have the same total force.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Both bugs are stationary with respect to the wheel, and thus feel zero net force.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
