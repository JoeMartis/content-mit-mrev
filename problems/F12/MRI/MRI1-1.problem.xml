<!-- MRI problem 1 -->

<problem>

	<p>An L shaped block of mass m<sub>2</sub> and a box of mass m<sub>1</sub> \( (m_2 > m_1) \) are connected by a horizontal spring of spring constant k. The spring is compressed a distance X with respect to its equilibrium length and a rope is used to hold the block and the box motionless together as shown in the figure 1. There <b>is friction between the block and the box</b> but there is <b>no friction between the L shaped block and the ground</b>. </p>

	<p>When the rope is cut the spring expands to recover its equilibrium position. As a result, the box moves to the left and the L-shaped box to the right as shown in figure 2.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Which of the following statements accurately describes the linear momentum of the block-box-spring system during the time interval that starts 
	at the instant at which the rope is cut, and ends at the instant at which the box is moving with speed V<sub>1</sub> and the block is moving with 
	V<sub>2</sub>?</p>
