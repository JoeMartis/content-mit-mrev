	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>You give the cart a push and release it. What happens?</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The cart travels in a straight line forever.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The cart travels in a straight line and slows down until it stops.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The cart stops moving as soon as you let go of it.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Newtonâ€™s First Law says that objects in motion remain in motion</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Friction removes mechanical energy from the shopping cart.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Mechanical energy is conserved in this situation.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">There is a force involved other than the push and friction.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The force that you exert on the shopping cart diminishes with time.</choice>
