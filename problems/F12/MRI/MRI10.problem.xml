<!-- MRI problem 10 -->

<problem>
	
	<p>A small block of mass m slides on a long horizontal table when it encounters a wedge of mass 2m and height h (see the diagram).</p>
	<img src="/static/problems/F12/MRI/images/MRI10b.png" />
	<p>The wedge can also slide along the table. The mass slides up the wedge all the way to the top and then slides back down, never getting over the top. 
	All surfaces are frictionless.</p>
	<p>Consider three moments in time: 
	<ul>
		<li>t1 – when the block is on the table, before sliding up the wedge; </li>
		<li>t2 – when the block is at the top of the wedge;</li>
		<li>t3 – when the block is on the table, after sliding down the wedge.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>The speed of the block is: </p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The greatest at t1</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The greatest at t3</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The same at t1 and t3</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Zero at t2</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The horizontal component of the momentum of the block-wedge system and the mechanical energy of the block-wedge-Earth system are conserved.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The energy of the block-wedge-Earth system is conserved but the momentum of the block-wedge system is not.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The momentum of the block-wedge system is conserved but the energy is not</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">There is no friction between the wedge and the block.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
