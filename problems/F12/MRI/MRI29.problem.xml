<problem>
	
	<p>A brick of mass m slides down a frictionless slope of height h. You may treat the brick as a point object. At the bottom of the slope is a flat patch 
	with friction. </p>

<br/>
	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<br/>
	<p>The goal is to determine the eventual speed of the brick after it has moved along the flat area for a given time \(t\). Consider the following approach for 
	determining the speed.</p>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li> Use kinematics to determine the speed of the brick at the bottom of the slope.</li>
		<li> Use the mass of the brick to determine the normal force.</li>
		<li> Calculate the frictional force on the brick.</li>
		<li> Calculate the acceleration provided by this force.</li>
		<li> Use kinematics to determine the velocity of the brick at the given time.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>That solution has an error. At what step does this error appear? (Enter a number from 1 to 5).</p>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<br/>
	<p>How do you know that the error is there?</p>
