<problem>
	
	<p>A projectile is launched horizontally from a certain height over a flat terrain. The horizontal range of the projectile equals the height from which the projectile is launched. Neglect resistive forces.</p>
	
	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Consider the angle \(\theta\) that the landing velocity vector makes with the ground. What statement about angle \(\theta\) is correct?</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">\(\theta = 45\deg \)</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">\(\theta\) is greater than \(45\deg \)</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">\(\theta\) is less than \(45\deg \)</choice>
		</choicegroup>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>Which of the following statements about \(\theta\) is correct? </p>

	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The information given in the problem is sufficient to calculate \(\theta\)</choice>
