<problem>

	<p><i>This question presents a complex problem that may need to be broken into smaller sections in order to be solved. The diagram for the problem is broken into 7 arbitrary parts, or intervals. After the problem is presented, there will be several options for breaking the problem into manageable sub-problems. Choose the one answer that best describes how the problem should be divided.</i></p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>A block of mass M has an initial speed v (as shown above). It slides a distance d along a rough surface with coefficient of kinetic friction \( \mu \). The block then collides with a massless spring of spring constant k. The block compresses the spring a distance x along the surface (which is still rough) before coming to rest. The goal of this problem is to determine the speed v in terms of the other quantities. What is the most appropriate way to decompose the problem? </p>
