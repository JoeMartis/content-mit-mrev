<!-- MRI problem 18 -->

<problem>
	
	<p>A bowl full of sand rests on a frictionless surface. A spinning disc is dropped onto the sand. Eventually the bowl, sand, and disk are spinning at the same rate.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Which of the following statements are true for the system of disc, bowl, and sand?</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Mechanical energy is conserved</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Mechanical energy is not conserved</choice>
		</choicegroup>
	</multiplechoiceresponse>

	<h3>Part 2</h3>
	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Mechanical energy is always conserved.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Frictional forces conserve mechanical energy.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Friction removes mechanical energy from the system.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Objects naturally lose energy as time goes on.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Friction provides the same torque on the sand and the disc.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">All the torques in this problem are internal to the system of disc, bowl, and sand.</choice>
		</choicegroup>
