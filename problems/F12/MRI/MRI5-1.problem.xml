    <p><i>This question presents a complex problem that may need to be broken into smaller sections in order to be solved. The diagram for the problem is broken into 7 arbitrary parts, or intervals. After the problem is presented, there will be several options for breaking the problem into manageable sub-problems. Choose the one answer that best describes how the problem should be divided.</i></p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>The block of mass M is released from rest at the top of a frictionless slide at height H above the ground (see figure above). The block slides smoothly down the slide and leaves the slide moving perfectly horizontally at a height h. The block is supposed to land in the water, a distance d from the end of the slide. The goal of the problem would be to find the minimum height H for the slide, assuming that h, d and M are known. What is the most appropriate way to decompose the problem?</p>
