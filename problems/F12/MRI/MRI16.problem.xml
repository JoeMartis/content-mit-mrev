<!-- MRI problem 16 -->

<problem>
	
	<p>Two uniform bars have masses and lengths of \(m\), \(l\) and \(2m\), \(2l\), respectively. The bars are pivoted at the common frictionless hinge as 
	shown. Initially, the bars are held horizontally. Then, they are released in such a way (not at the same instant of time) that they collide, 
	inelastically, at the bottom position. After that, the bars swing upward together. No resistive forces at the pivot act either before or after the collision.</p>

	<p>Consider the following quantities: linear momentum, angular momentum, kinetic energy, mechanical energy.</p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>Which of these quantities is conserved from the moment the first bar is released to the moment when the bars come to momentary rest at the top of 
	their upward swing?</p>
