	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Mechanical energy is conserved in all areas in this problem.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">Mechanical energy is conserved in areas without friction.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">Mechanical energy is conserved in areas without friction and in areas where the ball is rolling without slipping.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">When the ball moves from the frictionless slope to the flat area with friction, the transition can be modeled as a collision.</choice>
