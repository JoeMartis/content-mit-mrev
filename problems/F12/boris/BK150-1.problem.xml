<!-- BK problem 150, MIT-level -->
<problem>
	
	<p>The following series of questions refer to the “modified” Atwood machine, as shown in the diagram. (As usual, we assume ideal strings and pulleys.) </p>
	<img src="/static/problems/F12/boris/images/BK150_mod_atwood.png" width="300" />
	<p>Finding the general solutions for the accelerations of the blocks and the tensions in the strings is surprisingly difficult (compared to the two-block Atwood machine) and algebraically tedious. However, you are not expected to find the general solution in order to answer the questions below. </p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>What is the relationship between the accelerations of the blocks a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub> and a<sub>3</sub>? (Accelerations are assumed to be positive if they are directed downward.)</p>
