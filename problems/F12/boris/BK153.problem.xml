	<p>A tennis ball is dropped from a very large height on the ground. The ball undergoes a perfectly elastic collision. </p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>What is the direction and the magnitude of the ball’s acceleration immediately <i>after</i> it hits the ground? Assume that the air resistance is <b>negligible</b>.</p>
