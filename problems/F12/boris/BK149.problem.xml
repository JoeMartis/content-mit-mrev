	<p>A common Atwood machine looks like this: two blocks, connected by a string that passes over a pulley, suspended from a rigid support. If the masses of the blocks are known, it is relatively easy to find the accelerations of the blocks and the tension of the string that connects them. (Common assumptions are: the string is massless and un-stretchable and the pulley is massless and frictionless.) However, you are not expected to solve the general case in order to answer the questions below. </p>
