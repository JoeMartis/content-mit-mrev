<problem>
	
	<p>A uniform bar of mass \(M\) and length \(D\) is rotating and translating along a horizontal and frictionless surface contained in the x-y plane. The 
	bar is rotating counterclockwise as viewed from the screen with angular speed \( \omega \) and it is translating with speed \(v\) along the +x axis. At 
	the instant \(t_2\), the third picture in the figure below, what is the angular momentum about the point <font size="4" color="red"><b><i>Q</i></b></font> on the dashed straight line? You can type "omega" for \( \omega \).</p>
