<problem>
	
	<p>A uniform bar of mass \(M\) and length \(D\) is rotating and translating along a horizontal and frictionless surface contained in the x-y plane. The 
	bar is rotating counterclockwise as viewed from the screen with angular speed \(\omega\) and it is translating with speed \(v\) along the +x axis.  At the instant 
	\(t_1\), the middle picture in the figure below, what is the velocity of a point at the lower end of the bar? You can type "omega" for \( \omega \)</p>
