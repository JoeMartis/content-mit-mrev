<problem>
	
	<p>A uniform bar of mass M and length D is rotating is rotating counterclockwise as viewed from above with an angular speed \( \omega \) about an axis
	 passing through one of its ends (point Q) and perpendicular to the screen (x-y plane). What is the kinetic energy of the bar? You can type "omega" 
	 for \( \omega \).</p>
