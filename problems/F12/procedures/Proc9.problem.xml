	<p>What is the net torque about point <b>c</b> at the rim of the disc? Assume gravity is not present and take the positive direction as shown. You can 
	type "F1" and "F2" for the appropriate forces, and "theta" for \( \theta \).</p>

	<formularesponse answer="-(1/3)*R*F1 - (1+cos(theta))*R*F2" samples="R,F1,F2,theta@1,1,1,1:10,10,10,10#4">
