<problem>
	
	<p>A disk of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\) is rotating about its axis. A small cylinder of mass \(m\) and very small radius is placed on the surface of 
	the disk at a distance \(R/2\) from the center. The disk is rotating with angular speed \( \omega \). The cylinder does not move relative to the disk.</p>
	<img src="/static/problems/F12/procedures/images/proc6.png" />
	<p>What is the moment of inertia (about the center of mass of the disk) for the object consisting of the disk and the cylinder?</p>

	<formularesponse type="cs" answer="(1/2)*M*(R^2) + m*((R/2)^2)" samples="m,M,R@1,1,1:10,10,10#4">
