<h2>About This Course</h2>

<p>Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics.  It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics.</p>

<p>Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, and angular momentum. Optional units include oscillations, planetary orbits, and a review of multi-concept problems.</p>

<h2>Why Take Our Course?</h2>

<p>Our approach to mechanics is a unique one. Through worked examples and online texts we introduce a strategic overview of core concepts in mechanics. This overview couples with a new approach to problem-solving that will help you break down and solve multi-concept problems. By choosing a <i>system</i> of objects, defining their <i>interactions</i>, and deciding on a <i>model</i> to use to describe them, you will come to solve physics problems more easily and more systematically.</p>

<p>The road to "easy" goes through "hard." This course is more challenging than a standard high school or introductory college physics offering. We will help you become a more expert problem solver, and that process involves solving a variety of problems, in many different ways, with our new approach. The reward is stronger problem-solving ability that carries over to other areas in physics.</p>

<p>Take this course to better organize your mechanics knowledge, to prepare for AP or advanced standing exams, to teach more effectively, or if you enjoy attacking challenging problems!</p>

<h2>For Teachers</h2>

<p>If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up. Our <a href="http://relate.mit.edu/current-projects/maps-pedagogy/">approach</a> has been researched carefully and has <a href="http://www.compadre.org/portal/items/detail.cfm?ID=10476">proven effectiveness</a> when it comes to preparing students for later courses.</p>

<p>Teachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/recert/2000guidelines/sect2.html">Professional Development Points</a> (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state, we instead offer <a href="http://www.iacet.org/ceus/about-the-ceu">Continuing Education Units</a> through the <a href="http://www.aapt.org/">American Association of Physics Teachers</a>. There is a fee for this certificate.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <article class="response">
		<h3>Is there a required textbook?</h3>
		<p>You do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in the edX course and is viewable online.</p>
		<p>If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by <i>Halliday and Resnick</i>, <i>Young and Freedman</i>, or <i>Knight</i> are all appropriate.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="response">
		<h3>What if I take a vacation?</h3>
		<p>The course schedule is designed with this in mind! You can work three weeks ahead in the course, and the exams are one week after the material. Even if you have a four-week vacation, you do not need to miss any deadlines and can still complete all of the material.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="response">
		<h3>Will I earn a certificate?</h3>
		<p>Yes! This course awards certificates to all who satisfactorily complete the required portion of the course.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="response">
		<h3>How are grades assigned?</h3>
		<p>There are three parts of the course that are worth points: Checkpoint problems that are folded in with the reading, Homework problems that come at the end of each unit, and Quizzes that are at the end of every 1-2 units. Each is worth a varying number of points, and you will not have to do every problem.</p> 
		<p>The course consists of 11 required units and three optional units. You do not need to complete the optional units in order to receive a certificate.</p>
		<p>There is no final exam.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="response">
		<h3>How does this course use video?</h3>
		<p>We use video only when appropriate, to convey specific concepts or tackle specific questions. There are no required videos to watch each week. The majority of our course is delivered through text, worked examples, and problems.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="response">
		<h3>Can I still register after the start date?</h3>
		<p>Yes! The first homework is not due until June 23rd, and the first quiz is June 30th.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="response">
		<h3>I'm a teacher from outside Massachusetts and wish to receive Continuing Education Units (CEU) through the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) for successfully completing this course. How much will it cost to get this certificate?</h3>
		<p>The CEU certificates from AAPT will cost about $250.</p>
